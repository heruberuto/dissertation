# Automated Fact Checking in Czech

This repository contains code and experiments for my dissertation on automated fact checking in the Czech language.

## Overview

The project focuses on developing and evaluating automated fact checking systems specifically designed for Czech text. This includes:

- **Dataset Development**: Creating and curating Czech fact checking datasets
- **Model Development**: Training and fine-tuning language models for Czech fact verification
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation of fact checking performance on Czech content
- **Analysis**: Comparative studies of different approaches and methodologies

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Datasets and data processing scripts
- `models/` - Model implementations and training code
- `experiments/` - Experimental setups and evaluation scripts
- `results/` - Analysis results and findings
- `docs/` - Documentation and research notes

## Research Focus

The dissertation addresses the challenges of automated fact checking in Czech, including:
- Language-specific linguistic patterns and structures
- Czech-specific misinformation patterns
- Evaluation metrics adapted for Czech language characteristics
- Cross-lingual transfer learning approaches
