       "{'decomposition': ChatPromptTemplate(input_variables=['excerpt', 'question', 'sentence'], input_types={}, partial_variables={}, messages=[SystemMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=[], input_types={}, partial_variables={}, template='You are an assistant for a group of fact-checkers. You will be given a question, which was asked about a source text (it may be referred to by other names, \\ne.g., a dataset). You will also be given an excerpt from a response to the question. If it contains \"[...]\", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. You will also be given a particular sentence from the response. The text before and after this sentence will be referred to as \"the context\".\\n\\nYour task is to identify all specific and verifiable propositions in the sentence and ensure that each proposition is decontextualized. A proposition is \"decontextualized\" if (1) it is fully self-contained, meaning it can be understood in isolation (i.e., without the question, the context, and the other propositions), AND (2) its meaning in isolation matches its meaning when interpreted alongside the question, the context, and the other propositions. The propositions should also be the simplest possible discrete units of \\ninformation.\\n\\nNote the following rules:\\n- Here are some examples of sentences that do NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition:\\n    - By prioritizing ethical considerations, companies can ensure that their innovations are not only groundbreaking but also socially responsible\\n    - Technological progress should be inclusive\\n    - Leveraging advanced technologies is essential for maximizing productivity\\n    - Networking events can be crucial in shaping the paths of young entrepreneurs and providing them with valuable connections\\n    - AI could lead to advancements in healthcare\\n- Sometimes a specific and verifiable proposition is buried in a sentence that is mostly generic or unverifiable. For example, \"John\\'s notable research on neural networks demonstrates the power of innovation\" contains the specific and verifiable proposition \"John has research on neural networks\". Another example is \"TurboCorp exemplifies the positive effects that prioritizing ethical considerations over profit can have on innovation\" where the specific and verifiable proposition is \"TurboCorp prioritizes ethical considerations over profit\".\\n- If the sentence indicates that a specific entity said or did something, it is critical that you retain this context when creating the propositions. For example, if the sentence is \"John highlights the importance of transparent communication, such as in Project Alpha, which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\", the propositions would be [\"John highlights the importance of transparent communication\", \"John highlights Project Alpha as an example of the importance of transparent communication\", \\n\"Project Alpha aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\"]. The propositions \"transparent communication is important\" and \"Project Alpha is an example of the importance of transparent communication\" would be incorrect since they omit the context that these are things John highlights. However, the last part of the sentence, \"which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\", is not likely a statement made by John, so it can be its own proposition. Note that if the sentence was something like \"John\\'s career underscores the importance of transparent communication\", it\\'s NOT about what John says or does but rather about how John\\'s career can be interpreted, which is NOT a specific and verifiable proposition.\\n- If the context contains \"[...]\", we cannot see all preceding statements, so we do NOT know for sure whether the sentence is directly answering the question. It might be background information for some statements we can\\'t see.

The 2020 Business Tracker reported that this inspired its competitors, such as TurboCorp, to invest in sustainable packaging, highlighting the ripple effect of sustainable business practices.\\nClaims (C): {{\\n1: \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that MiniCorp inspired its competitors to invest in sustainable packaging\",\\n2: \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that TurboCorp was inspired by MiniCorp\",\\n3: \"TurboCorp is a competitor of MiniCorp\",\\n4: \"TurboCorp invested in sustainable packaging because it was inspired by MiniCorp\",\\n5: \"MiniCorp inspiring its competitors to adopt sustainable practice illustrates the ripple effect of sustainable business practices in the fashion industry\",\\n}}\\nElements (E): {{\\n1: \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly scarves has inspired its competitors to invest in sustainable packaging\",\\n2: \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that TurboCorp is an example of a competitor of MiniCorp that has been inspired by MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly scarves to invest in sustainable packaging\",\\n3: \"This highlights the ripple effect of sustainable business practices\",\\n}}\\n\\nE1: The 2020 Business Tracker reported that MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly scarves has inspired its competitors to invest in sustainable packaging\\n- The Statements and Actions Rule applies because the element is about what the 2020 Business Tracker reported\\n- C1 says \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that MiniCorp inspired its competitors to invest in sustainable packaging\"\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? It does not specify that it was MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly products that inspired its\\ncompetitors. Therefore E1 is not fully covered by C\\nE2: The 2020 Business Tracker reported that TurboCorp is an example of a competitor of MiniCorp that has been inspired by MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly products to invest in sustainable packaging\\n- The Statements and Actions Rule applies because the element is about what the 2020 Business Tracker reported\\n- C2 says \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that TurboCorp was inspired by MiniCorp\" and C3 says \"TurboCorp is a competitor of MiniCorp\" and C4 says \\n\"TurboCorp invested in sustainable packaging because it was inspired by \\nMiniCorp\"\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C?, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage Only C2 explicitly states that it was reported by the 2020 Business Tracker, and C does not specify that it was MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly products that inspired TurboCorp. Therefore E2 is not fully covered by C\\nE3: This highlights the ripple effect of sustainable business practices\\n- C5 says \"MiniCorp inspiring its competitors to adopt sustainable practice illustrates the ripple effect of sustainable business practices in the fashion industry\"\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? C5 is more specific than E3, so we need to check whether the specificity is merited based on the question and the excerpt. The question is about the key factors driving the shift towards sustainability in the fashion industry, and the excerpt discusses MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly scarves, so this specificity is merited. Therefore E3 is fully covered by C\\n\\n### Example 2\\nQuestion: Who are key figures in the corporate sustainability movement?\\nExcerpt from response: There are also ongoing efforts to use partnerships as a means to improve sustainability, as demonstrated by Jane Smith. Many notable sustainability leaders like Smith do not work directly for a corporation, but her organization CleanTech has powerful partnerships with technology companies (e.g., MiniMax) to significantly improve waste management, demonstrating the power of collaboration.\\nClaims (C): {{\\n1: \"Jane is a sustainability leader\",\\n2: \"Jane doesn\\'t work directly for a corporation\",\\n3: \"CleanTech has partnerships with technology companies to improve waste management\",\\n4: \"CleanTech has a partnership with MiniMax\",\\n}}\\nElements (E): {{\\n1: \"Jane Smith is an example of a notable sustainability leader [note: \\'notable\\' is not verifiable, but the rest is verifiable]\",\\n2: \"Jane Smith does not work directly for a corporation\",\\n3: \"Jane Smith has an organization called CleanTech\",\\n4: \"CleanTech has powerful partnerships with technology companies to significantly improve waste management [note: \\'powerful\\' and \\'significantly\\' are not verifiable, but the rest is verifiable]\",\\n5: \"MiniMax is a technology company\",\\n6: \"CleanTech has a partnership with MiniMax to significantly improve waste management [note: \\'significantly\\' is not verifiable, but the rest is verifiable]\",\\n7: \"CleanTech demonstrates the power of collaboration\",\\n}}\\n\\nElement 1: Jane Smith is an example of a notable sustainability leader\\n- C1 says \"Jane is a sustainability leader\", and \"notable\" is not verifiable so it can be ignored\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? Nothing. The verifiable parts of the element are explicitly stated. Therefore E1 is fully covered by C\\nElement 2: Jane Smith does not work directly for a corporation\\n- C2 says \"Jane does not work directly for a corporation\"\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? Nothing. The element is explicitly stated. Therefore E2 is fully covered by C\\nElement 3: Jane Smith has an organization called CleanTech\\n- C does not state that CleanTech is Jane\\'s organization\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? Nothing. The element is explicitly stated. Therefore E3 is not fully covered by C\\nElement 4: CleanTech has powerful partnerships with technology companies to significantly improve waste management\\n- C3 says \"CleanTech has partnerships with technology companies to improve waste management\", and \"powerful\" and \"significantly\" are not verifiable so they can be ignored\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? Nothing. The verifiable parts of the element are explicitly stated. Therefore E4 is fully covered by C\\nElement 5: MiniMax is a technology company\\n- C4 says \"CleanTech has a partnership with MiniMax\"\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? It does not say that MiniMax is a technology company. Therefore E5 is not fully covered by C\\nElement 6: CleanTech has a partnership with MiniMax to significantly improve waste management\\n- C4 says \"CleanTech has a partnership with MiniMax\"\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? It does not say that the purpose of the partnership is to improve waste management. Therefore E6 is not fully covered by C\\nElement 7: CleanTech demonstrates the power of collaboration\\n- C3 says \"CleanTech has partnerships with technology companies to improve waste management\"\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? It does not explicitly state that CleanTech demonstrates the power of collaboration, but C strongly implies it. Therefore it is implied that E7 is fully covered by C'), additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['claims', 'elements', 'excerpt', 'question'], input_types={}, partial_variables={}, template='Question (context for E):\\n{question}\\n\\nExcerpt from response (context for E):\\n{excerpt}\\n\\nClaims (C):\\n{claims}\\n\\nElements (E):\\n{elements}'), additional_kwargs={})]),\n",
       " 'entailment': ChatPromptTemplate(input_variables=['claim', 'excerpt', 'question', 'sentence'], input_types={}, partial_variables={}, messages=[SystemMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=[], input_types={}, partial_variables={}, template='## Overview\\nYou will be given a question, an excerpt from the response to the question, a sentence of interest from the excerpt (which will be referred to as S), and a claim (which will be referred to as C).\\n\\nA sentence entails a claim if when the sentence is true, the claim must also be true. Your task is to determine whether S entails C by following these steps:\\n1. Print \"S = <insert sentence of interest here EXACTLY as written>\"\\n2. Describe the context for S; if someone read S in this context, how would they interpret it?\\n3. Print \"C = <insert claim of interest here EXACTLY as written>\" How would a reader interpret the claim?\\n4. What are ALL elements of C? It\\'s possible there\\'s only one element. Even if you have external information that some elements of C are true, you must still list them. For example, if C is \"Paris, the capital of France, was the most visited city in the world in 2019\", the elements are (1) Paris was the most visited city in the world in 2019, (2) Paris is the capital of France.\\n5. Does the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? See the description of the rule and its exceptions below.\\n6. Ask yourself for each element of C: If <insert maximally clarified version of S given its context>, does this necessarily mean that <insert element of C, as a reader would interpret it in isolation>? Then respond with: <insert step-by-step reasoning>, so <insert yes or no>. You CANNOT use any external information (e.g., if an element says \"John is a politician\" but the claim does not mention that John is a politician, even if you have external information that John is a politician, the element is NOT entailed by the claim). Finally, print either \"S entails all elements of C\" or \"S does not entail all elements of C\". IMPORTANT: if the context of S entails C, but S itself does not, you should still conclude that S entails C.\\n\\nIf the sentence is something like \"John found X\", \"John reported X\", \"John emphasizes X\", etc. (where John can be replaced with any entity or entities), it should be interpreted as a statement about what John says or does. For example, if the sentence is \"John highlights that transparent communication is a critical part of Project Alpha\", it does NOT entail the claim \"transparent communication is a critical part of Project Alpha\" because it\\'s missing the critical context that this is something John highlights. Let\\'s call this the Statements and Actions Rule. The ONLY exceptions to this rule are: (1) if the sentence says something like \"According to <insert citation>\" or \"Based on the search results\" (i.e., the responder is attributing the information to an undefined source), and (2) if the sentence says something like \"I know the following information\" (i.e. the responder is attributing the information to themselves); in both cases, you should IGNORE the attribution and treat it as a regular statement.\\n\\n## Examples\\n### Example 1\\nQuestion: What are the rules for Bright Futures participations?\\nExcerpt from response: The program selects students based on their grades, test scores, and extracurricular activities. Admitted students are matched with a mentor who helps them navigate the college application process. They are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering, summer school, or job training.\\nSentence of interest: They are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering, summer school, or job training.\\nClaim: Students admitted to the Bright Futures program are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering.\\n\\nS = They are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering, summer school, or job training.\\nDescribe the context for S; if someone read S in this context, how would they interpret it? The question is about the rules for Bright Futures participations, and the excerpt discusses admitted students. Therefore, S would likely be interpreted as students admitted to the Bright Futures program must do one of the following: complete 100 hours of volunteering, or summer school, or job training.\\nC = Students admitted to the Bright Futures program are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering\\nA reader would interpret the claim as the Bright Futures program requires students to complete 100 hours of volunteering alone.\\nWhat are ALL elements of C? (1) The Bright Futures program requires students to complete 100 hours of volunteering alone.\\nDoes the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? S is not about an entity\\'s actions or statements, so it does not apply.\\nIf students admitted to the Bright Futures program can fulfill the requirement by completing 100 hours of volunteering, summer school, or job training, does this necessarily mean that they are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering alone? Volunteering is just one option to fulfill the requirement, so no. Therefore, S does not entail all elements of C.\\n \\n### Example 2\\nQuestion: Provide an overview of the media\\'s portrayal of AI.\\nExcerpt from response: ## Case Study 2\\nAnother example is the discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity.\\nSentence of interest: Another example is the discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity.\\nClaim: GitHub Copilot boosts developers\\' productivity.\\n\\nS = Another example is the discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity.\\nDescribe the context for S; if someone read S in this context, how would they interpret it? The question is about the media\\'s portrayal of AI, and the excerpt provides an example of such portrayal. Therefore, S would likely be interpreted as there is a discussion on the Behind the Tech about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity.\\nC = GitHub Copilot, a tool developed by Microsoft, boosts developers\\' productivity.\\nA reader would interpret the claim as GitHub Copilot, which is a tool developed by Microsoft, boosts developers\\' productivity.\\nWhat are ALL elements of C? (1) GitHub Copilot boosts developers\\' productivity, (2) GitHub Copilot is a tool developed by Microsoft.\\nDoes the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? S is a statement about what was discussed on the Behind the Tech podcast (GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity). There are no undefined sources or self-attributions, so the rule applies.\\nIf there was a discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity, does this necessarily mean that GitHub Copilot actually boosts developers\\' productivity? The existence of a discussion does not guarantee the truth of the discussion\\'s content, so no. \\nIf there was a discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity, does this necessarily mean that GitHub Copilot is a tool developed by Microsoft? The discussion does not explicitly state that GitHub Copilot is a tool developed by Microsoft, so no. Therefore, S does not entail all elements of C.\\n\\n### Example 3\\nQuestion: What was the impact of the tanker explosion in the Gulf of Mexico?\\nExcerpt from the response: The Earth Protectors, an environmental group, examined the remains of the tanker ship\\'s explosion. Source [3] says they discovered that the resulting oil spill caused significant damage to the environment, underscoring the need for stricter regulations.\\nSentence of interest: Source [3] says they discovered that the resulting oil spill caused significant damage to the environment, underscoring the need for stricter regulations.\\nClaim: They discovered the oil spill and its damage to the aquatic environment\\n\\nS = Source [3] says they discovered that the resulting oil spill caused significant damage to the environment, underscoring the need for stricter regulations.\\nDescribe the context for S; if someone read S in this context, how would they interpret it? The question is about the impact of the tanker explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, and the excerpt discusses the Earth Protectors\\' findings. Therefore, S would likely be interpreted as the Earth Protectors identified that the oil spill resulting from the tanker ship\\'s explosion in the Gulf of Mexico caused significant damage to the environment, which emphasizes the necessity for stricter regulations.\\nC = They discovered the oil spill and its damage to the aquatic environment\\nA reader would interpret the claim as the Earth Protectors discovered the oil spill itself, and they also discovered the damage that the oil spill caused to the aquatic environment.\\nWhat are ALL elements of C? (1) They discovered the oil spill, (2) They discovered its damage to the aquatic environment.\\nDoes the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? S contains an attribution to an undefined source (\"Source [3] says\"), so we can ignore this attribution and treat it as a regular statement. However, the rest of S is a statement about what the Earth Protectors discovered (the resulting oil spill caused significant damage to the environment), so it\\napplies.\\nIf the Earth Protectors identified that the oil spill caused significant damage to the environment, does this necessarily mean that they discovered the oil spill? Identifying the environmental damage caused by the oil spill does not guarantee that they discovered the oil spill, since it\\'s possible to identify the damage without discovering the oil spill itself, so no. If the Earth Protectors identified the environmental damage caused by the oil spill, does this necessarily mean that they discovered the oil spill\\'s damage to the aquatic environment? The environment is not necessarily the aquatic environment, so no.
