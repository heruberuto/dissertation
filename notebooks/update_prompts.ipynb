       "{'decomposition': {'system': 'You are an assistant for a group of fact-checkers. You will be given a question, which was asked about a source text (it may be referred to by other names, \\ne.g., a dataset). You will also be given an excerpt from a response to the question. If it contains \"[...]\", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. You will also be given a particular sentence from the response. The text before and after this sentence will be referred to as \"the context\".\\n\\nYour task is to identify all specific and verifiable propositions in the sentence and ensure that each proposition is decontextualized. A proposition is \"decontextualized\" if (1) it is fully self-contained, meaning it can be understood in isolation (i.e., without the question, the context, and the other propositions), AND (2) its meaning in isolation matches its meaning when interpreted alongside the question, the context, and the other propositions. The propositions should also be the simplest possible discrete units of \\ninformation.\\n\\nNote the following rules:\\n- Here are some examples of sentences that do NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition:\\n    - By prioritizing ethical considerations, companies can ensure that their innovations are not only groundbreaking but also socially responsible\\n    - Technological progress should be inclusive\\n    - Leveraging advanced technologies is essential for maximizing productivity\\n    - Networking events can be crucial in shaping the paths of young entrepreneurs and providing them with valuable connections\\n    - AI could lead to advancements in healthcare\\n- Sometimes a specific and verifiable proposition is buried in a sentence that is mostly generic or unverifiable. For example, \"John\\'s notable research on neural networks demonstrates the power of innovation\" contains the specific and verifiable proposition \"John has research on neural networks\". Another example is \"TurboCorp exemplifies the positive effects that prioritizing ethical considerations over profit can have on innovation\" where the specific and verifiable proposition is \"TurboCorp prioritizes ethical considerations over profit\".\\n- If the sentence indicates that a specific entity said or did something, it is critical that you retain this context when creating the propositions. For example, if the sentence is \"John highlights the importance of transparent communication, such as in Project Alpha, which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\", the propositions would be [\"John highlights the importance of transparent communication\", \"John highlights Project Alpha as an example of the importance of transparent communication\", \\n\"Project Alpha aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\"]. The propositions \"transparent communication is important\" and \"Project Alpha is an example of the importance of transparent communication\" would be incorrect since they omit the context that these are things John highlights. However, the last part of the sentence, \"which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\", is not likely a statement made by John, so it can be its own proposition. Note that if the sentence was something like \"John\\'s career underscores the importance of transparent communication\", it\\'s NOT about what John says or does but rather about how John\\'s career can be interpreted, which is NOT a specific and verifiable proposition.\\n- If the context contains \"[...]\", we cannot see all preceding statements, so we do NOT know for sure whether the sentence is directly answering the question. It might be background information for some statements we can\\'t see. Therefore, you should only assume the sentence is directly answering the question if this is strongly implied.\\n- Do NOT include any citations in the propositions.\\n- Do NOT use any external knowledge beyond what is stated in the question, context, and sentence.\\n\\nHere are some correct examples that you must pay attention to:\\n1.

Vagueness and generality are NOT linguistic ambiguity. Linguistic ambiguity includes referential and structural ambiguity. Temporal ambiguity is a type of referential ambiguity.\\n- If it is unclear whether the sentence is directly answering the question, you should NOT count this as linguistic ambiguity.

You will also be given a dictionary of claims extracted from the excerpt (which will be referred to as C), and a dictionary of elements (which will be referred to as E).\\n\\nAn element is \"covered by\" a claim if the element is explicitly stated or strongly implied by the claim. For each element in E, your task is to determine whether the information in the element is covered by C by following these steps:\\n1.

Determine whether the information in the element is covered by C. If the element has a note that some information is not verifiable, ignore that part and focus on the verifiable information. You CANNOT use any external information \\n(e.g., if the element says \"Politicians like John frequently discuss the \\neconomy\" and C says \"John frequently discusses the economy\" but there is no claim that John is a politician, even if you have external information that John is a politician, the element is not fully covered by C). If C is more specific than E, you must check whether the specificity is merited based on the question and the excerpt (i.e., if the elements should be more specific based on the \\ncontext); if it is merited, then the element is fully covered by C.

Let\\'s call this the Statements and Actions Rule.\\n\\n## Examples\\n### Example 1\\nQuestion: What are the key factors driving the shift towards sustainability in the fashion industry?\\nExcerpt from response: The growing public awareness of climate change has led to a surge in demand for sustainable fashion products. For example, MiniCorp recently launched a new line of eco-friendly scarves that have been well-received by consumers. The 2020 Business Tracker reported that this inspired its competitors, such as TurboCorp, to invest in sustainable packaging, highlighting the ripple effect of sustainable business practices.\\nClaims (C): {{\\n1: \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that MiniCorp inspired its competitors to invest in sustainable packaging\",\\n2: \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that TurboCorp was inspired by MiniCorp\",\\n3: \"TurboCorp is a competitor of MiniCorp\",\\n4: \"TurboCorp invested in sustainable packaging because it was inspired by MiniCorp\",\\n5: \"MiniCorp inspiring its competitors to adopt sustainable practice illustrates the ripple effect of sustainable business practices in the fashion industry\",\\n}}\\nElements (E): {{\\n1: \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly scarves has inspired its competitors to invest in sustainable packaging\",\\n2: \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that TurboCorp is an example of a competitor of MiniCorp that has been inspired by MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly scarves to invest in sustainable packaging\",\\n3: \"This highlights the ripple effect of sustainable business practices\",\\n}}\\n\\nE1: The 2020 Business Tracker reported that MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly scarves has inspired its competitors to invest in sustainable packaging\\n- The Statements and Actions Rule applies because the element is about what the 2020 Business Tracker reported\\n- C1 says \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that MiniCorp inspired its competitors to invest in sustainable packaging\"\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage?

Nothing. The verifiable parts of the element are explicitly stated. Therefore E1 is fully covered by C\\nElement 2: Jane Smith does not work directly for a corporation\\n- C2 says \"Jane does not work directly for a corporation\"\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? Nothing. The element is explicitly stated. Therefore E2 is fully covered by C\\nElement 3: Jane Smith has an organization called CleanTech\\n- C does not state that CleanTech is Jane\\'s organization\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? Nothing. The element is explicitly stated. Therefore E3 is not fully covered by C\\nElement 4: CleanTech has powerful partnerships with technology companies to significantly improve waste management\\n- C3 says \"CleanTech has partnerships with technology companies to improve waste management\", and \"powerful\" and \"significantly\" are not verifiable so they can be ignored\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? Nothing. The verifiable parts of the element are explicitly stated. Therefore E4 is fully covered by C\\nElement 5: MiniMax is a technology company\\n- C4 says \"CleanTech has a partnership with MiniMax\"\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? It does not say that MiniMax is a technology company.

Even if you have external information that some elements of C are true, you must still list them. For example, if C is \"Paris, the capital of France, was the most visited city in the world in 2019\", the elements are (1) Paris was the most visited city in the world in 2019, (2) Paris is the capital of France.\\n5. Does the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? See the description of the rule and its exceptions below.\\n6. Ask yourself for each element of C: If <insert maximally clarified version of S given its context>, does this necessarily mean that <insert element of C, as a reader would interpret it in isolation>? Then respond with: <insert step-by-step reasoning>, so <insert yes or no>. You CANNOT use any external information (e.g., if an element says \"John is a politician\" but the claim does not mention that John is a politician, even if you have external information that John is a politician, the element is NOT entailed by the claim). Finally, print either \"S entails all elements of C\" or \"S does not entail all elements of C\". IMPORTANT: if the context of S entails C, but S itself does not, you should still conclude that S entails C.\\n\\nIf the sentence is something like \"John found X\", \"John reported X\", \"John emphasizes X\", etc. (where John can be replaced with any entity or entities), it should be interpreted as a statement about what John says or does.

Let\\'s call this the Statements and Actions Rule. The ONLY exceptions to this rule are: (1) if the sentence says something like \"According to <insert citation>\" or \"Based on the search results\" (i.e., the responder is attributing the information to an undefined source), and (2) if the sentence says something like \"I know the following information\" (i.e. the responder is attributing the information to themselves); in both cases, you should IGNORE the attribution and treat it as a regular statement.\\n\\n## Examples\\n### Example 1\\nQuestion: What are the rules for Bright Futures participations?\\nExcerpt from response: The program selects students based on their grades, test scores, and extracurricular activities. Admitted students are matched with a mentor who helps them navigate the college application process. They are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering, summer school, or job training.\\nSentence of interest: They are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering, summer school, or job training.\\nClaim: Students admitted to the Bright Futures program are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering.\\n\\nS = They are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering, summer school, or job training.\\nDescribe the context for S; if someone read S in this context, how would they interpret it? The question is about the rules for Bright Futures participations, and the excerpt discusses admitted students. Therefore, S would likely be interpreted as students admitted to the Bright Futures program must do one of the following: complete 100 hours of volunteering, or summer school, or job training.\\nC = Students admitted to the Bright Futures program are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering\\nA reader would interpret the claim as the Bright Futures program requires students to complete 100 hours of volunteering alone.\\nWhat are ALL elements of C? (1) The Bright Futures program requires students to complete 100 hours of volunteering alone.\\nDoes the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? S is not about an entity\\'s actions or statements, so it does not apply.\\nIf students admitted to the Bright Futures program can fulfill the requirement by completing 100 hours of volunteering, summer school, or job training, does this necessarily mean that they are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering alone? Volunteering is just one option to fulfill the requirement, so no. Therefore, S does not entail all elements of C.\\n \\n### Example 2\\nQuestion: Provide an overview of the media\\'s portrayal of AI.\\nExcerpt from response: ## Case Study 2\\nAnother example is the discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity.\\nSentence of interest: Another example is the discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity.\\nClaim: GitHub Copilot boosts developers\\' productivity.\\n\\nS = Another example is the discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity.\\nDescribe the context for S; if someone read S in this context, how would they interpret it?

Therefore, S would likely be interpreted as there is a discussion on the Behind the Tech about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity.\\nC = GitHub Copilot, a tool developed by Microsoft, boosts developers\\' productivity.\\nA reader would interpret the claim as GitHub Copilot, which is a tool developed by Microsoft, boosts developers\\' productivity.\\nWhat are ALL elements of C? (1) GitHub Copilot boosts developers\\' productivity, (2) GitHub Copilot is a tool developed by Microsoft.\\nDoes the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? S is a statement about what was discussed on the Behind the Tech podcast (GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity). There are no undefined sources or self-attributions, so the rule applies.\\nIf there was a discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity, does this necessarily mean that GitHub Copilot actually boosts developers\\' productivity? The existence of a discussion does not guarantee the truth of the discussion\\'s content, so no. \\nIf there was a discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity, does this necessarily mean that GitHub Copilot is a tool developed by Microsoft? The discussion does not explicitly state that GitHub Copilot is a tool developed by Microsoft, so no. Therefore, S does not entail all elements of C.\\n\\n### Example 3\\nQuestion: What was the impact of the tanker explosion in the Gulf of Mexico?\\nExcerpt from the response: The Earth Protectors, an environmental group, examined the remains of the tanker ship\\'s explosion. Source [3] says they discovered that the resulting oil spill caused significant damage to the environment, underscoring the need for stricter regulations.\\nSentence of interest: Source [3] says they discovered that the resulting oil spill caused significant damage to the environment, underscoring the need for stricter regulations.\\nClaim: They discovered the oil spill and its damage to the aquatic environment\\n\\nS = Source [3] says they discovered that the resulting oil spill caused significant damage to the environment, underscoring the need for stricter regulations.\\nDescribe the context for S; if someone read S in this context, how would they interpret it? The question is about the impact of the tanker explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, and the excerpt discusses the Earth Protectors\\' findings. Therefore, S would likely be interpreted as the Earth Protectors identified that the oil spill resulting from the tanker ship\\'s explosion in the Gulf of Mexico caused significant damage to the environment, which emphasizes the necessity for stricter regulations.\\nC = They discovered the oil spill and its damage to the aquatic environment\\nA reader would interpret the claim as the Earth Protectors discovered the oil spill itself, and they also discovered the damage that the oil spill caused to the aquatic environment.\\nWhat are ALL elements of C? (1) They discovered the oil spill, (2) They discovered its damage to the aquatic environment.\\nDoes the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? S contains an attribution to an undefined source (\"Source [3] says\"), so we can ignore this attribution and treat it as a regular statement. However, the rest of S is a statement about what the Earth Protectors discovered (the resulting oil spill caused significant damage to the environment), so it\\napplies.\\nIf the Earth Protectors identified that the oil spill caused significant damage to the environment, does this necessarily mean that they discovered the oil spill? Identifying the environmental damage caused by the oil spill does not guarantee that they discovered the oil spill, since it\\'s possible to identify the damage without discovering the oil spill itself, so no. If the Earth Protectors identified the environmental damage caused by the oil spill, does this necessarily mean that they discovered the oil spill\\'s damage to the aquatic environment? The environment is not necessarily the aquatic environment, so no. Therefore, S does not entail all elements of C.'},\n",
