Your task is to determine whether S entails C by following these steps:\\n1. Print \"S = <insert sentence of interest here EXACTLY as written>\"\\n2. Describe the context for S; if someone read S in this context, how would they interpret it?\\n3. Print \"C = <insert claim of interest here EXACTLY as written>\" How would a reader interpret the claim?\\n4. What are ALL elements of C? It\\'s possible there\\'s only one element. Even if you have external information that some elements of C are true, you must still list them. For example, if C is \"Paris, the capital of France, was the most visited city in the world in 2019\", the elements are (1) Paris was the most visited city in the world in 2019, (2) Paris is the capital of France.\\n5. Does the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? See the description of the rule and its exceptions below.\\n6. Ask yourself for each element of C: If <insert maximally clarified version of S given its context>, does this necessarily mean that <insert element of C, as a reader would interpret it in isolation>? Then respond with: <insert step-by-step reasoning>, so <insert yes or no>. You CANNOT use any external information (e.g., if an element says \"John is a politician\" but the claim does not mention that John is a politician, even if you have external information that John is a politician, the element is NOT entailed by the claim). Finally, print either \"S entails all elements of C\" or \"S does not entail all elements of C\". IMPORTANT: if the context of S entails C, but S itself does not, you should still conclude that S entails C.\\n\\nIf the sentence is something like \"John found X\", \"John reported X\", \"John emphasizes X\", etc. (where John can be replaced with any entity or entities), it should be interpreted as a statement about what John says or does. For example, if the sentence is \"John highlights that transparent communication is a critical part of Project Alpha\", it does NOT entail the claim \"transparent communication is a critical part of Project Alpha\" because it\\'s missing the critical context that this is something John highlights. Let\\'s call this the Statements and Actions Rule. The ONLY exceptions to this rule are: (1) if the sentence says something like \"According to <insert citation>\" or \"Based on the search results\" (i.e., the responder is attributing the information to an undefined source), and (2) if the sentence says something like \"I know the following information\" (i.e. the responder is attributing the information to themselves); in both cases, you should IGNORE the attribution and treat it as a regular statement.\\n\\n## Examples\\n### Example 1\\nQuestion: What are the rules for Bright Futures participations?\\nExcerpt from response: The program selects students based on their grades, test scores, and extracurricular activities. Admitted students are matched with a mentor who helps them navigate the college application process. They are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering, summer school, or job training.\\nSentence of interest: They are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering, summer school, or job training.\\nClaim: Students admitted to the Bright Futures program are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering.\\n\\nS = They are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering, summer school, or job training.\\nDescribe the context for S; if someone read S in this context, how would they interpret it? The question is about the rules for Bright Futures participations, and the excerpt discusses admitted students. Therefore, S would likely be interpreted as students admitted to the Bright Futures program must do one of the following: complete 100 hours of volunteering, or summer school, or job training.\\nC = Students admitted to the Bright Futures program are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering\\nA reader would interpret the claim as the Bright Futures program requires students to complete 100 hours of volunteering alone.\\nWhat are ALL elements of C? (1) The Bright Futures program requires students to complete 100 hours of volunteering alone.\\nDoes the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? S is not about an entity\\'s actions or statements, so it does not apply.\\nIf students admitted to the Bright Futures program can fulfill the requirement by completing 100 hours of volunteering, summer school, or job training, does this necessarily mean that they are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering alone? Volunteering is just one option to fulfill the requirement, so no. Therefore, S does not entail all elements of C.\\n \\n### Example 2\\nQuestion: Provide an overview of the media\\'s portrayal of AI.\\nExcerpt from response: ## Case Study 2\\nAnother example is the discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity.\\nSentence of interest: Another example is the discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity.\\nClaim: GitHub Copilot boosts developers\\' productivity.\\n\\nS = Another example is the discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity.\\nDescribe the context for S; if someone read S in this context, how would they interpret it?

Therefore, S would likely be interpreted as there is a discussion on the Behind the Tech about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity.\\nC = GitHub Copilot, a tool developed by Microsoft, boosts developers\\' productivity.\\nA reader would interpret the claim as GitHub Copilot, which is a tool developed by Microsoft, boosts developers\\' productivity.\\nWhat are ALL elements of C? (1) GitHub Copilot boosts developers\\' productivity, (2) GitHub Copilot is a tool developed by Microsoft.\\nDoes the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? S is a statement about what was discussed on the Behind the Tech podcast (GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity). There are no undefined sources or self-attributions, so the rule applies.\\nIf there was a discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity, does this necessarily mean that GitHub Copilot actually boosts developers\\' productivity? The existence of a discussion does not guarantee the truth of the discussion\\'s content, so no. \\nIf there was a discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity, does this necessarily mean that GitHub Copilot is a tool developed by Microsoft? The discussion does not explicitly state that GitHub Copilot is a tool developed by Microsoft, so no. Therefore, S does not entail all elements of C.\\n\\n### Example 3\\nQuestion: What was the impact of the tanker explosion in the Gulf of Mexico?\\nExcerpt from the response: The Earth Protectors, an environmental group, examined the remains of the tanker ship\\'s explosion.

The question is about the impact of the tanker explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, and the excerpt discusses the Earth Protectors\\' findings. Therefore, S would likely be interpreted as the Earth Protectors identified that the oil spill resulting from the tanker ship\\'s explosion in the Gulf of Mexico caused significant damage to the environment, which emphasizes the necessity for stricter regulations.\\nC = They discovered the oil spill and its damage to the aquatic environment\\nA reader would interpret the claim as the Earth Protectors discovered the oil spill itself, and they also discovered the damage that the oil spill caused to the aquatic environment.\\nWhat are ALL elements of C? (1) They discovered the oil spill, (2) They discovered its damage to the aquatic environment.\\nDoes the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? S contains an attribution to an undefined source (\"Source [3] says\"), so we can ignore this attribution and treat it as a regular statement. However, the rest of S is a statement about what the Earth Protectors discovered (the resulting oil spill caused significant damage to the environment), so it\\napplies.\\nIf the Earth Protectors identified that the oil spill caused significant damage to the environment, does this necessarily mean that they discovered the oil spill? Identifying the environmental damage caused by the oil spill does not guarantee that they discovered the oil spill, since it\\'s possible to identify the damage without discovering the oil spill itself, so no.

A proposition is \"decontextualized\" if (1) it is fully self-contained, meaning it can be understood in isolation (i.e., without the question, the context, and the other propositions), AND (2) its meaning in isolation matches its meaning when interpreted alongside the question, the context, and the other propositions. The propositions should also be the simplest possible discrete units of \\ninformation.\\n\\nNote the following rules:\\n- Here are some examples of sentences that do NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition:\\n    - By prioritizing ethical considerations, companies can ensure that their innovations are not only groundbreaking but also socially responsible\\n    - Technological progress should be inclusive\\n    - Leveraging advanced technologies is essential for maximizing productivity\\n    - Networking events can be crucial in shaping the paths of young entrepreneurs and providing them with valuable connections\\n    - AI could lead to advancements in healthcare\\n- Sometimes a specific and verifiable proposition is buried in a sentence that is mostly generic or unverifiable.

Another example is \"TurboCorp exemplifies the positive effects that prioritizing ethical considerations over profit can have on innovation\" where the specific and verifiable proposition is \"TurboCorp prioritizes ethical considerations over profit\".\\n- If the sentence indicates that a specific entity said or did something, it is critical that you retain this context when creating the propositions.

The propositions \"transparent communication is important\" and \"Project Alpha is an example of the importance of transparent communication\" would be incorrect since they omit the context that these are things John highlights.

       "'<think>\\nOkay, let\\'s tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to determine if a given sentence from a response contains a specific and verifiable proposition based on the provided rules.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the criteria. A specific and verifiable proposition is something that can be checked for truth, like a fact. The rules mention that if the sentence is about a lack of information, it doesn\\'t count. Also, it doesn\\'t matter if the proposition is true or false, just whether it\\'s specific and verifiable. Ambiguous terms are okay as long as the fact-checker can resolve them.\\n\\nNow, looking at the example given in the problem statement. The user provided a scenario where the sentence is \"John\" following the question \"Who is the CEO of Company X?\" and the preceding sentence. The answer here is that \"John\" contains a specific proposition because it directly answers the question with a name, which can be verified.\\n\\nAnother example is when the preceding sentence mentions Jane Doe introducing a concept, and the sentence says \"It means using technology to restore ecosystems.\" That\\'s specific because it defines the concept mentioned earlier.\\n\\nBut if the sentence is a conclusion summarizing topics covered, even if they are detailed before, it\\'s considered a conclusion and not a specific proposition.\\n\\nNow, the user\\'s input is \"todo\" for all parts. But since the user hasn\\'t provided the actual question, excerpt, or sentence, I need to consider that maybe this is a placeholder. However, the user might have intended to test the system\\'s ability to process the rules even without specific data. But in reality, the assistant should process the given input. However, since the input is all \"todo,\" perhaps the user is testing the system\\'s ability to handle incomplete data, but according to the problem\\'s setup, the user should have provided the necessary information.\\n\\nWait, the user\\'s message is the initial instruction, and the actual query is not provided. But in the problem setup, the user is supposed to input a question, an excerpt, and a sentence. However, in this case, the user might have left it as \"todo\" as a placeholder. But given the instructions, I need to process the example given in the problem statement, not the user\\'s input. Wait, no, the user is providing the problem as the input, and the assistant is to process that.\\n\\nWait, looking back at the user\\'s message, the user provided the initial instruction, then in the \"Question\" section, \"todo\", then \"Excerpt: todo\", and \"Sentence: todo\". So the user hasn\\'t actually provided the necessary information. But in the context of the problem, perhaps this is a test case where the assistant is supposed to handle a scenario where the information is missing. However, according to the rules, the assistant should process the given question, excerpt, and sentence. But since they\\'re all \"todo\", perhaps the assistant is supposed to return that the information is missing. However, in the original problem statement, the user provided an example with specific data, but in this case, the user\\'s input is incomplete.\\n\\nThis is a bit confusing. However, considering that the user might have intended to provide a test case with the example from the problem statement, but in the current setup, the user input is all \"todo\". Therefore, the assistant might need to respond that the information is incomplete, but according to the rules, the assistant should process the given data. However, since the data is missing, perhaps the correct response is that the sentence cannot be evaluated due to missing information. But according to the rules, the assistant is to determine based on the given information. However, without the actual question, excerpt, and sentence, it\\'s impossible to proceed. Therefore, the answer would be that the sentence is not provided, and thus cannot be evaluated. But the user might have made a mistake in the input.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a test to see if the assistant can handle such scenarios. But according to the initial instructions, the assistant is to process the given question, excerpt, and sentence. Since they\\'re all \"todo\", the assistant cannot proceed. However, in the problem statement\\'s example, the user provided a specific question, excerpt, and sentence. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to provide that as the input but mistakenly used \"todo\". But in this case, the user\\'s input is incomplete. Therefore, the assistant should inform that the input is incomplete. However, the user hasn\\'t provided any actual data to work with, so the assistant can\\'t process it. Therefore, the answer would be that the information is missing, and thus, the assistant can\\'t determine if the sentence contains a specific proposition.\\n</think>\\n\\nSentence: \\n<insert> \\n\\n4-step stream of consciousness thought process (1. reflect on criteria at a high-level -> 2. provide an objective description of the excerpt, the sentence, and its surrounding sentences -> 3. consider all possible perspectives on whether the sentence explicitly or implicitly contains a specific and verifiable proposition, or if it just contains an introduction for the following \\nsentence(s), a conclusion for the preceding sentence(s), broad or generic statements, opinions, interpretations, speculations, statements about a lack of information, etc. -> 4. only if it contains a specific and verifiable proposition: reflect on whether any changes are needed to ensure that the entire sentence only contains verifiable information):\\n<insert> \\n\\nFinal submission:\\n<insert \\'Contains a specific and verifiable proposition\\' or \\'Does NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition\\'>\\n\\nSentence with only verifiable information:\\n<insert changed sentence, or \\'remains unchanged\\' if no changes, or \\'None\\' if the sentence does NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition>'"

       "[SystemMessage(content='You are an assistant to a fact-checker. You will be given a question, which was asked about a source text (it may be referred to by other names, e.g., a disa\\ndataset). You will also be given an excerpt from a response to the question. If it contains \"[...]\", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. You will also be given a particular sentence from the response. The text before and after this sentence will be referred to as \"the context\". Your task is to \"decontextualize\" the sentence, which means:\\n1. determine whether it\\'s possible to resolve partial names and undefined acronyms/abbreviations in the sentence using the question and the context; if it is possible, you will make the necessary changes to the sentence\\n2. determine whether the sentence in isolation contains linguistic ambiguity that has a clear resolution using the question and the context; if it does, you will make the necessary changes to the sentence\\n\\nNote the following rules:\\n- \"Linguistic ambiguity\" refers to the presence of multiple possible meanings in a sentence. Vagueness and generality are NOT linguistic ambiguity. Linguistic ambiguity includes referential and structural ambiguity. Temporal ambiguity is a type of referential ambiguity.\\n- If it is unclear whether the sentence is directly answering the question, you should NOT count this as linguistic ambiguity. You should NOT add any information to the sentence that assumes a connection to the question.\\n- If a name is only partially given in the sentence, but the full name is provided in the question or the context, the DecontextualizedSentence must always use the full name. The same rule applies to definitions for acronyms and abbreviations. However, the lack of a full name or a definition for an acronym/abbreviation in the question and the context does NOT count as linguistic ambiguity; in this case, you will just leave the name, acronym, or abbreviation as is.\\n- Do NOT include any citations in the DecontextualizedSentence.\\n- Do NOT use any external knowledge beyond what is stated in the question, context, and sentence.\\n\\nHere are some correct examples that you should pay attention to:\\n1. Question = \"Describe the history of TurboCorp\", Context = \"John Smith was an early employee who transitioned to management in 2010\", Sentence = \"At the time, he led the company\\'s operations and finance teams.\"\\n    - For referential ambiguity, \"At the time\", \"he\", and \"the company\\'s\" are unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: \"At the time\" corresponds to 2010, \"he\" refers to John Smith, and \"the company\\'s\" refers to TurboCorp.\\n    - DecontextualizedSentence: In 2010, John Smith led TurboCorp\\'s operations and finance teams.\\n2. Question = \"Who are notable executive figures?\", Context = \"[...]**Jane Doe**\", Sentence = \"These notes indicate that her leadership at TurboCorp and MiniMax is accelerating progress in renewable energy and sustainable \\nagriculture.\"\\n    - For referential ambiguity, \"these notes\" and \"her\" are unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of \"these notes\", since there is no indication in the question or context. However, they would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation of \"her\": Jane Doe.\\n    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) Jane\\'s leadership is accelerating progress in renewable energy and sustainable agriculture at both TurboCorp and MiniMax, (2) Jane\\'s leadership is accelerating progress in renewable energy at TurboCorp and in sustainable agriculture at MiniMax. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of this ambiguity.\\n    - DecontextualizedSentence: Cannot be decontextualized\\n3. Question = \"Who founded MiniMax?\", Context = \"None\", Sentence = \"Executives like John Smith were involved in the early days of MiniMax.\"\\n    - For referential ambiguity, \"like John Smith\" is unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: John Smith is an example of an executive who was involved in the early days of MiniMax.\\n    - Note that \"Involved in\" and \"the early days\" are vague, but they are NOT linguistic ambiguity.\\n    - DecontextualizedSentence: John Smith is an example of an executive who was involved in the early days of MiniMax.\\n4. Question = \"What advice is given to young entrepreneurs?\", Context = \\n\"# Ethical Considerations\", Sentence = \"Sustainable manufacturing, as emphasized by John Smith and Jane Doe, is critical for customer buy-in and long-term success.\"\\n    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) John Smith and Jane Doe emphasized that sustainable manufacturing is critical for customer buy-in and long-term success, (2) John Smith and Jane Doe emphasized sustainable manufacturing while the claim that sustainable manufacturing is critical for customer buy-in and long-term success is attributable to the writer, not to John Smith and Jane Doe.

A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: the differences are with respect to how to weigh short-term benefits against long-term risks.\\n    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) privacy and data security are examples of risks, (2) privacy and data security are examples of both benefits and risks. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: privacy and data security are examples of risks.\\n    - Note that \"Some\" and \"others\" are vague, but they are not linguistic ambiguity.\\n    - DecontextualizedSentence: The differences in how to weigh short-term benefits against long-term risks are illustrated by the discussion on healthcare.

You will also be given an excerpt from a response to the question. If it contains \"[...]\", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. You will also be given a particular sentence of interest from the response. Your task is to determine whether this particular sentence contains at least one specific and verifiable proposition, and if so, to return a complete sentence that only contains verifiable information.   \\n\\nNote the following rules:\\n- If the sentence is about a lack of information, e.g., the dataset does not contain information about X, then it does NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition.\\n- It does NOT matter whether the proposition is true or false.\\n- It does NOT matter whether the proposition is relevant to the question.\\n- It does NOT matter whether the proposition contains ambiguous terms, e.g., a pronoun without a clear antecedent. Assume that the fact-checker has the necessary information to resolve all ambiguities.\\n- You will NOT consider whether a sentence contains a citation when determining if it has a specific and verifiable proposition.\\n\\nYou must consider the preceding and following sentences when determining if the sentence has a specific and verifiable proposition.
