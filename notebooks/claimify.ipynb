       "'<think>\\nOkay, let\\'s tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to determine if a given sentence from a response contains a specific and verifiable proposition based on the provided rules.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the criteria. A specific and verifiable proposition is something that can be checked for truth, like a fact. The rules mention that if the sentence is about a lack of information, it doesn\\'t count. Also, it doesn\\'t matter if the proposition is true or false, just whether it\\'s specific and verifiable. Ambiguous terms are okay as long as the fact-checker can resolve them.\\n\\nNow, looking at the example given in the problem statement. The user provided a scenario where the sentence is \"John\" following the question \"Who is the CEO of Company X?\" and the preceding sentence. The answer here is that \"John\" contains a specific proposition because it directly answers the question with a name, which can be verified.\\n\\nAnother example is when the preceding sentence mentions Jane Doe introducing a concept, and the sentence says \"It means using technology to restore ecosystems.\" That\\'s specific because it defines the concept mentioned earlier.\\n\\nBut if the sentence is a conclusion summarizing topics covered, even if they are detailed before, it\\'s considered a conclusion and not a specific proposition.\\n\\nNow, the user\\'s input is \"todo\" for all parts. But since the user hasn\\'t provided the actual question, excerpt, or sentence, I need to consider that maybe this is a placeholder. However, the user might have intended to test the system\\'s ability to process the rules even without specific data. But in reality, the assistant should process the given input. However, since the input is all \"todo,\" perhaps the user is testing the system\\'s ability to handle incomplete data, but according to the problem\\'s setup, the user should have provided the necessary information.\\n\\nWait, the user\\'s message is the initial instruction, and the actual query is not provided. But in the problem setup, the user is supposed to input a question, an excerpt, and a sentence. However, in this case, the user might have left it as \"todo\" as a placeholder. But given the instructions, I need to process the example given in the problem statement, not the user\\'s input. Wait, no, the user is providing the problem as the input, and the assistant is to process that.\\n\\nWait, looking back at the user\\'s message, the user provided the initial instruction, then in the \"Question\" section, \"todo\", then \"Excerpt: todo\", and \"Sentence: todo\". So the user hasn\\'t actually provided the necessary information. But in the context of the problem, perhaps this is a test case where the assistant is supposed to handle a scenario where the information is missing. However, according to the rules, the assistant should process the given question, excerpt, and sentence. But since they\\'re all \"todo\", perhaps the assistant is supposed to return that the information is missing. However, in the original problem statement, the user provided an example with specific data, but in this case, the user\\'s input is incomplete.\\n\\nThis is a bit confusing. However, considering that the user might have intended to provide a test case with the example from the problem statement, but in the current setup, the user input is all \"todo\". Therefore, the assistant might need to respond that the information is incomplete, but according to the rules, the assistant should process the given data. However, since the data is missing, perhaps the correct response is that the sentence cannot be evaluated due to missing information. But according to the rules, the assistant is to determine based on the given information. However, without the actual question, excerpt, and sentence, it\\'s impossible to proceed. Therefore, the answer would be that the sentence is not provided, and thus cannot be evaluated. But the user might have made a mistake in the input.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a test to see if the assistant can handle such scenarios. But according to the initial instructions, the assistant is to process the given question, excerpt, and sentence. Since they\\'re all \"todo\", the assistant cannot proceed. However, in the problem statement\\'s example, the user provided a specific question, excerpt, and sentence. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to provide that as the input but mistakenly used \"todo\". But in this case, the user\\'s input is incomplete. Therefore, the assistant should inform that the input is incomplete. However, the user hasn\\'t provided any actual data to work with, so the assistant can\\'t process it. Therefore, the answer would be that the information is missing, and thus, the assistant can\\'t determine if the sentence contains a specific proposition.\\n</think>\\n\\nSentence: \\n<insert> \\n\\n4-step stream of consciousness thought process (1. reflect on criteria at a high-level -> 2. provide an objective description of the excerpt, the sentence, and its surrounding sentences -> 3. consider all possible perspectives on whether the sentence explicitly or implicitly contains a specific and verifiable proposition, or if it just contains an introduction for the following \\nsentence(s), a conclusion for the preceding sentence(s), broad or generic statements, opinions, interpretations, speculations, statements about a lack of information, etc. -> 4. only if it contains a specific and verifiable proposition: reflect on whether any changes are needed to ensure that the entire sentence only contains verifiable information):\\n<insert> \\n\\nFinal submission:\\n<insert \\'Contains a specific and verifiable proposition\\' or \\'Does NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition\\'>\\n\\nSentence with only verifiable information:\\n<insert changed sentence, or \\'remains unchanged\\' if no changes, or \\'None\\' if the sentence does NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition>'"

       "[SystemMessage(content='You are an assistant for a group of fact-checkers. You will be given a question, which was asked about a source text (it may be referred to by other names, \\ne.g., a dataset). You will also be given an excerpt from a response to the question. If it contains \"[...]\", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. You will also be given a particular sentence from the response. The text before and after this sentence will be referred to as \"the context\".\\n\\nYour task is to identify all specific and verifiable propositions in the sentence and ensure that each proposition is decontextualized. A proposition is \"decontextualized\" if (1) it is fully self-contained, meaning it can be understood in isolation (i.e., without the question, the context, and the other propositions), AND (2) its meaning in isolation matches its meaning when interpreted alongside the question, the context, and the other propositions. The propositions should also be the simplest possible discrete units of \\ninformation.\\n\\nNote the following rules:\\n- Here are some examples of sentences that do NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition:\\n    - By prioritizing ethical considerations, companies can ensure that their innovations are not only groundbreaking but also socially responsible\\n    - Technological progress should be inclusive\\n    - Leveraging advanced technologies is essential for maximizing productivity\\n    - Networking events can be crucial in shaping the paths of young entrepreneurs and providing them with valuable connections\\n    - AI could lead to advancements in healthcare\\n- Sometimes a specific and verifiable proposition is buried in a sentence that is mostly generic or unverifiable. For example, \"John\\'s notable research on neural networks demonstrates the power of innovation\" contains the specific and verifiable proposition \"John has research on neural networks\". Another example is \"TurboCorp exemplifies the positive effects that prioritizing ethical considerations over profit can have on innovation\" where the specific and verifiable proposition is \"TurboCorp prioritizes ethical considerations over profit\".\\n- If the sentence indicates that a specific entity said or did something, it is critical that you retain this context when creating the propositions. For example, if the sentence is \"John highlights the importance of transparent communication, such as in Project Alpha, which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\", the propositions would be [\"John highlights the importance of transparent communication\", \"John highlights Project Alpha as an example of the importance of transparent communication\", \\n\"Project Alpha aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\"]. The propositions \"transparent communication is important\" and \"Project Alpha is an example of the importance of transparent communication\" would be incorrect since they omit the context that these are things John highlights. However, the last part of the sentence, \"which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\", is not likely a statement made by John, so it can be its own proposition. Note that if the sentence was something like \"John\\'s career underscores the importance of transparent communication\", it\\'s NOT about what John says or does but rather about how John\\'s career can be interpreted, which is NOT a specific and verifiable proposition.\\n- If the context contains \"[...]\", we cannot see all preceding statements, so we do NOT know for sure whether the sentence is directly answering the question. It might be background information for some statements we can\\'t see. Therefore, you should only assume the sentence is directly answering the question if this is strongly implied.\\n- Do NOT include any citations in the propositions.\\n- Do NOT use any external knowledge beyond what is stated in the question, context, and sentence.\\n\\nHere are some correct examples that you must pay attention to:\\n1.

You will also be given an excerpt from a response to the question. If it contains \"[...]\", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. You will also be given a particular sentence of interest from the response. Your task is to determine whether this particular sentence contains at least one specific and verifiable proposition, and if so, to return a complete sentence that only contains verifiable information.   \\n\\nNote the following rules:\\n- If the sentence is about a lack of information, e.g., the dataset does not contain information about X, then it does NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition.\\n- It does NOT matter whether the proposition is true or false.\\n- It does NOT matter whether the proposition is relevant to the question.\\n- It does NOT matter whether the proposition contains ambiguous terms, e.g., a pronoun without a clear antecedent. Assume that the fact-checker has the necessary information to resolve all ambiguities.\\n- You will NOT consider whether a sentence contains a citation when determining if it has a specific and verifiable proposition.\\n\\nYou must consider the preceding and following sentences when determining if the sentence has a specific and verifiable proposition.
