You will be given a question, which was asked about a source text (it may be referred to by other names, e.g., a dataset). You will also be given an excerpt from a response to the question. If it contains \"[...]\", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. You will also be given a particular sentence from the response. The text before and after this sentence will be referred to as \"the context\".\\n\\nCRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: You must ALWAYS respond in the same language as the source text for ALL CONTENT. If the input sentence is in Spanish, respond in Spanish. If it is in French, respond in French. If it is in German, respond in German, etc. Never translate or change the language of the content - preserve the original language exactly. All extracted propositions must be in the same language as the input sentence. HOWEVER, keep all structural elements, format keywords, and system responses in English (e.g., section headers, \"None\").\\n\\nYour task is to identify all specific and verifiable propositions in the sentence and ensure that each proposition is decontextualized. A proposition is \"decontextualized\" if (1) it is fully self-contained, meaning it can be understood in isolation (i.e., without the question, the context, and the other propositions), AND (2) its meaning in isolation matches its meaning when interpreted alongside the question, the context, and the other propositions. The propositions should also be the simplest possible discrete units of information.\\n\\nNote the following rules:\\n- Here are some examples of sentences that do NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition:\\n  - By prioritizing ethical considerations, companies can ensure that their innovations are not only groundbreaking but also socially responsible\\n  - Technological progress should be inclusive\\n  - Leveraging advanced technologies is essential for maximizing productivity\\n  - Networking events can be crucial in shaping the paths of young entrepreneurs and providing them with valuable connections\\n  - AI could lead to advancements in healthcare\\n- Sometimes a specific and verifiable proposition is buried in a sentence that is mostly generic or unverifiable. For example, \"John\\'s notable research on neural networks demonstrates the power of innovation\" contains the specific and verifiable proposition \"John has research on neural networks\". Another example is \"TurboCorp exemplifies the positive effects that prioritizing ethical considerations over profit can have on innovation\" where the specific and verifiable proposition is \"TurboCorp prioritizes ethical considerations over profit\".\\n- If the sentence indicates that a specific entity said or did something, it is critical that you retain this context when creating the propositions. For example, if the sentence is \"John highlights the importance of transparent communication, such as in Project Alpha, which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\", the propositions would be [\"John highlights the importance of transparent communication\", \"John highlights Project Alpha as an example of the importance of transparent communication\", \"Project Alpha aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\"]. The propositions \"transparent communication is important\" and \"Project Alpha is an example of the importance of transparent communication\" would be incorrect since they omit the context that these are things John highlights. However, the last part of the sentence, \"which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\", is not likely a statement made by John, so it can be its own proposition. Note that if the sentence was something like \"John\\'s career underscores the importance of transparent communication\", it\\'s NOT about what John says or does but rather about how John\\'s career can be interpreted, which is NOT a specific and verifiable proposition.\\n- If the context contains \"[...]\", we cannot see all preceding statements, so we do NOT know for sure whether the sentence is directly answering the question. It might be background information for some statements we can\\'t see. Therefore, you should only assume the sentence is directly answering the question if this is strongly implied.\\n- Do NOT include any citations in the propositions.\\n- Do NOT use any external knowledge beyond what is stated in the question, context, and sentence.\\n\\nEach proposition must be:\\n- Specific: It should refer to particular entities, events, or relationships\\n- Verifiable: It should be possible to determine whether the proposition is true or false by consulting reliable sources\\n- Decontextualized: It should be understandable without additional context\\n\\nImportant rules:\\n- Do NOT include any citations in the propositions\\n- Do NOT use any external knowledge beyond what is stated in the question, context, and sentence\\n- Each fact-checker will only have access to one proposition - they will not have access to the question, context, and other propositions\\n- Add essential clarifications and context in square brackets [...] where needed\\n\\nFor the final claims, you must create structured objects with:\\n- text: The claim text with essential context/clarifications in brackets\\n- verifiable: Always set to true (this helps you focus on creating claims that can be fact-checked)\\n\\nIt is EXTREMELY important that you consider that each fact-checker in the group will only have access to one of the propositions - they will not have access to the question, the context, and the other propositions. Therefore, you must include **all essential clarifications and context** enclosed in square brackets [...]. For example, the proposition \"The local council expects its law to pass in January 2025\" might become \"The [Boston] local council expects its law [banning plastic bags] to pass in January 2025\"; the proposition \"Other agencies decreased their deficit\" might become \"Other agencies [besides the Department of Education and the Department of Defense] increased their deficit [relative to 2023]\".

You will also be given a dictionary of claims extracted from the excerpt (which will be referred to as C), and a dictionary of elements (which will be referred to as E).\\n\\nAn element is \"covered by\" a claim if the element is explicitly stated or strongly implied by the claim. For each element in E, your task is to determine whether the information in the element is covered by C by following these steps:\\n1. Print \"E<insert number here>: <insert element here EXACTLY as written>\" where number is the key in the dictionary and element is the value.\\n2. Determine whether the information in the element is covered by C. If the element has a note that some information is not verifiable, ignore that part and focus on the verifiable information. You CANNOT use any external information \\n(e.g., if the element says \"Politicians like John frequently discuss the \\neconomy\" and C says \"John frequently discusses the economy\" but there is no claim that John is a politician, even if you have external information that John is a politician, the element is not fully covered by C). If C is more specific than E, you must check whether the specificity is merited based on the question and the excerpt (i.e., if the elements should be more specific based on the \\ncontext); if it is merited, then the element is fully covered by C. Print either \"fully covered by C\" or \"not fully covered by C\".\\n3. Repeat this process for all elements in E.\\n\\nIf the element is something like \"John found X\", \"John reported X\", \"John emphasizes X\", etc. (where John can be replaced with any entity or entities), it should be interpreted as a statement about what John says or does. For example, if the element is \"John highlights that transparent communication is a critical part of Project Alpha\", the claim \"transparent communication is a critical part of Project Alpha\" does not cover the element because it\\'s missing the critical context that this is something John highlights. Let\\'s call this the Statements and Actions Rule.\\n\\n## Examples\\n### Example 1\\nQuestion: What are the key factors driving the shift towards sustainability in the fashion industry?\\nExcerpt from response: The growing public awareness of climate change has led to a surge in demand for sustainable fashion products. For example, MiniCorp recently launched a new line of eco-friendly scarves that have been well-received by consumers. The 2020 Business Tracker reported that this inspired its competitors, such as TurboCorp, to invest in sustainable packaging, highlighting the ripple effect of sustainable business practices.\\nClaims (C): {{\\n1: \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that MiniCorp inspired its competitors to invest in sustainable packaging\",\\n2: \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that TurboCorp was inspired by MiniCorp\",\\n3: \"TurboCorp is a competitor of MiniCorp\",\\n4: \"TurboCorp invested in sustainable packaging because it was inspired by MiniCorp\",\\n5: \"MiniCorp inspiring its competitors to adopt sustainable practice illustrates the ripple effect of sustainable business practices in the fashion industry\",\\n}}\\nElements (E): {{\\n1: \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly scarves has inspired its competitors to invest in sustainable packaging\",\\n2: \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that TurboCorp is an example of a competitor of MiniCorp that has been inspired by MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly scarves to invest in sustainable packaging\",\\n3: \"This highlights the ripple effect of sustainable business practices\",\\n}}\\n\\nE1: The 2020 Business Tracker reported that MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly scarves has inspired its competitors to invest in sustainable packaging\\n- The Statements and Actions Rule applies because the element is about what the 2020 Business Tracker reported\\n- C1 says \"The 2020 Business Tracker reported that MiniCorp inspired its competitors to invest in sustainable packaging\"\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage?

Therefore E2 is not fully covered by C\\nE3: This highlights the ripple effect of sustainable business practices\\n- C5 says \"MiniCorp inspiring its competitors to adopt sustainable practice illustrates the ripple effect of sustainable business practices in the fashion industry\"\\n- What is not explicitly stated or strongly implied by C, and is therefore grounds for lack of full coverage? C5 is more specific than E3, so we need to check whether the specificity is merited based on the question and the excerpt. The question is about the key factors driving the shift towards sustainability in the fashion industry, and the excerpt discusses MiniCorp\\'s success with its new line of eco-friendly scarves, so this specificity is merited. Therefore E3 is fully covered by C\\n\\n### Example 2\\nQuestion: Who are key figures in the corporate sustainability movement?\\nExcerpt from response: There are also ongoing efforts to use partnerships as a means to improve sustainability, as demonstrated by Jane Smith.

For example, if C is \"Paris, the capital of France, was the most visited city in the world in 2019\", the elements are (1) Paris was the most visited city in the world in 2019, (2) Paris is the capital of France.\\n5. Does the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? See the description of the rule and its exceptions below.\\n6.

You CANNOT use any external information (e.g., if an element says \"John is a politician\" but the claim does not mention that John is a politician, even if you have external information that John is a politician, the element is NOT entailed by the claim). Finally, print either \"S entails all elements of C\" or \"S does not entail all elements of C\". IMPORTANT: if the context of S entails C, but S itself does not, you should still conclude that S entails C.\\n\\nIf the sentence is something like \"John found X\", \"John reported X\", \"John emphasizes X\", etc. (where John can be replaced with any entity or entities), it should be interpreted as a statement about what John says or does.

Therefore, S would likely be interpreted as students admitted to the Bright Futures program must do one of the following: complete 100 hours of volunteering, or summer school, or job training.\\nC = Students admitted to the Bright Futures program are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering\\nA reader would interpret the claim as the Bright Futures program requires students to complete 100 hours of volunteering alone.\\nWhat are ALL elements of C? (1) The Bright Futures program requires students to complete 100 hours of volunteering alone.\\nDoes the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? S is not about an entity\\'s actions or statements, so it does not apply.\\nIf students admitted to the Bright Futures program can fulfill the requirement by completing 100 hours of volunteering, summer school, or job training, does this necessarily mean that they are required to complete 100 hours of volunteering alone? Volunteering is just one option to fulfill the requirement, so no.

The question is about the media\\'s portrayal of AI, and the excerpt provides an example of such portrayal. Therefore, S would likely be interpreted as there is a discussion on the Behind the Tech about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity.\\nC = GitHub Copilot, a tool developed by Microsoft, boosts developers\\' productivity.\\nA reader would interpret the claim as GitHub Copilot, which is a tool developed by Microsoft, boosts developers\\' productivity.\\nWhat are ALL elements of C? (1) GitHub Copilot boosts developers\\' productivity, (2) GitHub Copilot is a tool developed by Microsoft.\\nDoes the Statements and Actions Rule apply to S, or does it qualify as an exception? S is a statement about what was discussed on the Behind the Tech podcast (GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity). There are no undefined sources or self-attributions, so the rule applies.\\nIf there was a discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity, does this necessarily mean that GitHub Copilot actually boosts developers\\' productivity? The existence of a discussion does not guarantee the truth of the discussion\\'s content, so no. \\nIf there was a discussion on the Behind the Tech podcast about GitHub Copilot boosting developers\\' productivity, does this necessarily mean that GitHub Copilot is a tool developed by Microsoft? The discussion does not explicitly state that GitHub Copilot is a tool developed by Microsoft, so no. Therefore, S does not entail all elements of C.\\n\\n### Example 3\\nQuestion: What was the impact of the tanker explosion in the Gulf of Mexico?\\nExcerpt from the response: The Earth Protectors, an environmental group, examined the remains of the tanker ship\\'s explosion.

If it contains \"[...]\", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. You will also be given a particular sentence from the response. The text before and after this sentence will be referred to as \"the context\".\\n\\nCRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT: You must ALWAYS respond in the same language as the source text for ALL CONTENT. If the input sentence is in Spanish, respond in Spanish. If it is in French, respond in French. If it is in German, respond in German, etc. Never translate or change the language of the content - preserve the original language exactly.

HOWEVER, keep all structural elements, format keywords, and system responses in English (e.g., section headers, \"None\").\\n\\nYour task is to identify all specific and verifiable propositions in the sentence and ensure that each proposition is decontextualized. A proposition is \"decontextualized\" if (1) it is fully self-contained, meaning it can be understood in isolation (i.e., without the question, the context, and the other propositions), AND (2) its meaning in isolation matches its meaning when interpreted alongside the question, the context, and the other propositions. The propositions should also be the simplest possible discrete units of information.\\n\\nNote the following rules:\\n- Here are some examples of sentences that do NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition:\\n  - By prioritizing ethical considerations, companies can ensure that their innovations are not only groundbreaking but also socially responsible\\n  - Technological progress should be inclusive\\n  - Leveraging advanced technologies is essential for maximizing productivity\\n  - Networking events can be crucial in shaping the paths of young entrepreneurs and providing them with valuable connections\\n  - AI could lead to advancements in healthcare\\n- Sometimes a specific and verifiable proposition is buried in a sentence that is mostly generic or unverifiable. For example, \"John\\'s notable research on neural networks demonstrates the power of innovation\" contains the specific and verifiable proposition \"John has research on neural networks\". Another example is \"TurboCorp exemplifies the positive effects that prioritizing ethical considerations over profit can have on innovation\" where the specific and verifiable proposition is \"TurboCorp prioritizes ethical considerations over profit\".\\n- If the sentence indicates that a specific entity said or did something, it is critical that you retain this context when creating the propositions. For example, if the sentence is \"John highlights the importance of transparent communication, such as in Project Alpha, which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\", the propositions would be [\"John highlights the importance of transparent communication\", \"John highlights Project Alpha as an example of the importance of transparent communication\", \"Project Alpha aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\"]. The propositions \"transparent communication is important\" and \"Project Alpha is an example of the importance of transparent communication\" would be incorrect since they omit the context that these are things John highlights. However, the last part of the sentence, \"which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year\", is not likely a statement made by John, so it can be its own proposition. Note that if the sentence was something like \"John\\'s career underscores the importance of transparent communication\", it\\'s NOT about what John says or does but rather about how John\\'s career can be interpreted, which is NOT a specific and verifiable proposition.\\n- If the context contains \"[...]\", we cannot see all preceding statements, so we do NOT know for sure whether the sentence is directly answering the question. It might be background information for some statements we can\\'t see. Therefore, you should only assume the sentence is directly answering the question if this is strongly implied.\\n- Do NOT include any citations in the propositions.\\n- Do NOT use any external knowledge beyond what is stated in the question, context, and sentence.\\n\\nEach proposition must be:\\n- Specific: It should refer to particular entities, events, or relationships\\n- Verifiable: It should be possible to determine whether the proposition is true or false by consulting reliable sources\\n- Decontextualized: It should be understandable without additional context\\n\\nImportant rules:\\n- Do NOT include any citations in the propositions\\n- Do NOT use any external knowledge beyond what is stated in the question, context, and sentence\\n- Each fact-checker will only have access to one proposition - they will not have access to the question, context, and other propositions\\n- Add essential clarifications and context in square brackets [...] where needed\\n\\nFor the final claims, you must create structured objects with:\\n- text: The claim text with essential context/clarifications in brackets\\n- verifiable: Always set to true (this helps you focus on creating claims that can be fact-checked)\\n\\nIt is EXTREMELY important that you consider that each fact-checker in the group will only have access to one of the propositions - they will not have access to the question, the context, and the other propositions. Therefore, you must include **all essential clarifications and context** enclosed in square brackets [...]. For example, the proposition \"The local council expects its law to pass in January 2025\" might become \"The [Boston] local council expects its law [banning plastic bags] to pass in January 2025\"; the proposition \"Other agencies decreased their deficit\" might become \"Other agencies [besides the Department of Education and the Department of Defense] increased their deficit [relative to 2023]\".

       "[SystemMessage(content='You are an assistant to a fact-checker. You will be given a question, which was asked about a source text (it may be referred to by other names, e.g., a disa\\ndataset). You will also be given an excerpt from a response to the question. If it contains \"[...]\", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. You will also be given a particular sentence from the response. The text before and after this sentence will be referred to as \"the context\". Your task is to \"decontextualize\" the sentence, which means:\\n1. determine whether it\\'s possible to resolve partial names and undefined acronyms/abbreviations in the sentence using the question and the context; if it is possible, you will make the necessary changes to the sentence\\n2. determine whether the sentence in isolation contains linguistic ambiguity that has a clear resolution using the question and the context; if it does, you will make the necessary changes to the sentence\\n\\nNote the following rules:\\n- \"Linguistic ambiguity\" refers to the presence of multiple possible meanings in a sentence. Vagueness and generality are NOT linguistic ambiguity. Linguistic ambiguity includes referential and structural ambiguity. Temporal ambiguity is a type of referential ambiguity.\\n- If it is unclear whether the sentence is directly answering the question, you should NOT count this as linguistic ambiguity. You should NOT add any information to the sentence that assumes a connection to the question.\\n- If a name is only partially given in the sentence, but the full name is provided in the question or the context, the DecontextualizedSentence must always use the full name. The same rule applies to definitions for acronyms and abbreviations. However, the lack of a full name or a definition for an acronym/abbreviation in the question and the context does NOT count as linguistic ambiguity; in this case, you will just leave the name, acronym, or abbreviation as is.\\n- Do NOT include any citations in the DecontextualizedSentence.\\n- Do NOT use any external knowledge beyond what is stated in the question, context, and sentence.\\n\\nHere are some correct examples that you should pay attention to:\\n1. Question = \"Describe the history of TurboCorp\", Context = \"John Smith was an early employee who transitioned to management in 2010\", Sentence = \"At the time, he led the company\\'s operations and finance teams.\"\\n    - For referential ambiguity, \"At the time\", \"he\", and \"the company\\'s\" are unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: \"At the time\" corresponds to 2010, \"he\" refers to John Smith, and \"the company\\'s\" refers to TurboCorp.\\n    - DecontextualizedSentence: In 2010, John Smith led TurboCorp\\'s operations and finance teams.\\n2. Question = \"Who are notable executive figures?\", Context = \"[...]**Jane Doe**\", Sentence = \"These notes indicate that her leadership at TurboCorp and MiniMax is accelerating progress in renewable energy and sustainable \\nagriculture.\"\\n    - For referential ambiguity, \"these notes\" and \"her\" are unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of \"these notes\", since there is no indication in the question or context. However, they would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation of \"her\": Jane Doe.\\n    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) Jane\\'s leadership is accelerating progress in renewable energy and sustainable agriculture at both TurboCorp and MiniMax, (2) Jane\\'s leadership is accelerating progress in renewable energy at TurboCorp and in sustainable agriculture at MiniMax. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of this ambiguity.\\n    - DecontextualizedSentence: Cannot be decontextualized\\n3. Question = \"Who founded MiniMax?\", Context = \"None\", Sentence = \"Executives like John Smith were involved in the early days of MiniMax.\"\\n    - For referential ambiguity, \"like John Smith\" is unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: John Smith is an example of an executive who was involved in the early days of MiniMax.\\n    - Note that \"Involved in\" and \"the early days\" are vague, but they are NOT linguistic ambiguity.\\n    - DecontextualizedSentence: John Smith is an example of an executive who was involved in the early days of MiniMax.\\n4. Question = \"What advice is given to young entrepreneurs?\", Context = \\n\"# Ethical Considerations\", Sentence = \"Sustainable manufacturing, as emphasized by John Smith and Jane Doe, is critical for customer buy-in and long-term success.\"\\n    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) John Smith and Jane Doe emphasized that sustainable manufacturing is critical for customer buy-in and long-term success, (2) John Smith and Jane Doe emphasized sustainable manufacturing while the claim that sustainable manufacturing is critical for customer buy-in and long-term success is attributable to the writer, not to John Smith and Jane Doe. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of this ambiguity.\\n    - DecontextualizedSentence: Cannot be decontextualized\\n5. Question = \"What are common strategies for building successful teams?\", Context = \"One of the most common strategies is creating a diverse team.\", Sentence = \"Last winter, John Smith highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations, which can drive advancements by integrating diverse perspectives from fields such as artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and statistical machine learning.\"\\n    - For referential ambiguity, \"Last winter\" is unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of this ambiguity, since there is no indication of the time period in the question or context.\\n    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) John Smith highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations and that they can drive advancements by integrating diverse perspectives from some example fields, (2) John Smith only highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations while the claim that they can drive advancements by integrating diverse perspectives from some example fields is attributable to the writer, not to John Smith. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of this ambiguity.\\n    - DecontextualizedSentence: Cannot be decontextualized\\n6. Question = \"What opinions are provided on disruptive technologies?\", Context = \"[...]However, there is a divergence in how to weigh short-term benefits against long-term risks.\", Sentence = \"These differences are illustrated by the discussion on healthcare: some stress AI\\'s benefits, while others highlight its risks, such as privacy and data security.\"\\n    - For referential ambiguity, \"These differences\" is unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: the differences are with respect to how to weigh short-term benefits against long-term risks.\\n    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) privacy and data security are examples of risks, (2) privacy and data security are examples of both benefits and risks. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: privacy and data security are examples of risks.\\n    - Note that \"Some\" and \"others\" are vague, but they are not linguistic ambiguity.\\n    - DecontextualizedSentence: The differences in how to weigh short-term benefits against long-term risks are illustrated by the discussion on healthcare. Some experts stress AI\\'s benefits with respect to healthcare. Other experts highlight AI\\'s risks with respect to healthcare, such as privacy and data security.\\n\\nFirst, print \"Incomplete Names, Acronyms, Abbreviations:\" followed by your step-by-step reasoning for determining whether the Sentence contains any partial names and undefined acronyms/abbreviations. If the full names and definitions are provided in the question or context, the Sentence will be updated accordingly; otherwise, they will be left as is and they will NOT count as linguistic ambiguity. Next, print \"Linguistic Ambiguity in \\'<insert the \\nsentence>\\':\" followed by your step-by-step reasoning for checking (1) referential and (2) structural ambiguity (and note that 1. referential ambiguity is NOT equivalent to vague or general language and it includes temporal ambiguity, and 2. structural reasoning must follow \"The sentence could be interpreted as: <insert one or multiple interpretations>\"), then considering whether a group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus or fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of the linguistic ambiguity. If they would likely fail to reach consensus, print\\n\"DecontextualizedSentence: Cannot be decontextualized\"; otherwise, first print\\n\"Changes Needed to Decontextualize the Sentence:\" followed by a list of all changes needed to ensure the Sentence is fully decontextualized (e.g., replace \\n\"executives like John Smith\" with \"John Smith is an example of an executive who\") and includes all full names and definitions for acronyms/abbreviations (only if they were provided in the question and the context), then print \\n\"DecontextualizedSentence:\" followed by the final sentence (or collection of sentences) that implements all changes.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),\n",
