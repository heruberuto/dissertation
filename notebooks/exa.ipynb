      " New York City is beginning to feel like the center of the professional basketball world again. Months after the WNBA's Liberty won their first-ever title, the NBA's Knicks have snapped a decades-long Eastern Conference Finals drought to move within four wins of a Finals appearance and eight wins of a title. Fans in the Mecca of basketball have responded accordingly. Despite the drought, the Knicks are undeniably one of the most storied franchises in professional sports. With some of the greatest players in league history suiting up in orange and blue, New York has experienced some large-scale success, though it has been over 50 years since the franchise was the last one standing. 📲  Follow The Sporting News on WhatsApp With that in mind, The Sporting News revisits the Knicks' last NBA championship and the team's history in the NBA Finals. NBA PLAYOFFS HQ:   Live NBA scores  |  NBA playoff schedule  |  NBA playoff bracket When was the last time the Knicks won an NBA championship? The last time the Knicks won an NBA championship was in 1973. New York needed five games to defeat the Lakers on the game's biggest stage for the second time in four seasons. The 1973 Knicks team was a who's who of all-time greats, featuring five members of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team: Dave DeBusschere, Walt Frazier, Jerry Lucas, Earl Monroe, and Willis Reed. Reed was named Finals MVP with averages of 16.4 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists in the series, while Hall of Famer Bill Bradley led the team with 18.6 points per game in the series. In many ways, the 1972-73 Knicks felt like a team of destiny, surging their way through the playoffs with a 4-1 semifinals victory over the 52-win Baltimore Bullets (now Wizards) and a seven-game East Finals win over the 1-seed Celtics, who had won 68 games during the regular season. MORE:  Where Willis Reed's 1970 heroics rank among gutsiest performances in playoff history How many NBA championships have the Knicks won? The Knicks have won two championships in franchise history — both championship wins came in the 1970s. As one of the NBA's original franchises, the 1946-47 season was New York's first. After three consecutive Finals losses in the 1950s, the franchise finally got over the hump with a seven-game series win over the Lakers in the 1970 NBA Finals. Three years later, the Knicks' championship core remained largely intact when they needed just five games to defeat the Lakers in the 1973 Finals. Year Opponent Series MVP 1970 Lakers Knicks 4, Lakers 3 Willis Reed 1973 Lakers Knicks 4, Lakers 1 Willis Reed MORE:  Knicks vs. Pacers prediction and keys to the Eastern Conference Finals When was the last time the Knicks played in the NBA Finals? The Knicks' last NBA Finals appearance was in 1999 against the Spurs. San Antonio won the series, 4-1. New York has not been to the Finals since the turn of the century and, in addition to the Finals drought, had last appeared in the Eastern Conference Finals in 2000. The Knicks ended a 25-year conference finals drought with their run in 2025. Knicks NBA Finals history The Knicks have advanced to the NBA Finals eight times in franchise history, posting a 2-6 record in those series. New York's NBA Finals appearances are somewhat spread out, with three in the 1950s, three in the 1970s, and the remaining two in the 1990s. The franchise came painstakingly close to winning a title in 1994 but has not been able to hoist the trophy since 1973. Here is a breakdown of the Knicks' full NBA Finals history, which includes three Game 7 losses.

      "Behind a star-studded roster that included Walt Frazier, Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, Earl Monroe, and Jerry Lucas, the Knicks won their second NBA title in 1973. The first came in 1970 with a similar cast, and perhaps sweetest of all, both wins came against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1973 squad defeated the Lakers in five games, and Reed came away with his second Finals MVP trophy, becoming the first player to accomplish this feat. After a Game 1 loss in Los Angeles, the Knicks won four straight and closed the series out in L.A.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reed posted 16.4 points and 9.2 rebounds per game in that series. Bradley led the team in scoring with 18.6 points per game, Frazier led with 5.2 assists per game and DeBusschere had a team-high 11.6 rebounds per game.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1973 title marked another crowning achievement for the late Hall of Famer, but Reed is most remembered for the 1970 NBA Finals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reed averaged 31.8 points and 15.0 rebounds per game through the first four games of the 1970 Finals. The series was tied, 2-2, and Reed tore a thigh muscle late in Game 5, which the Knicks won. He sat out Game 6 and was doubtful for Game 7.\n",

      "That's when \"The Willis Reed Game\" was born. Reed jogged out of the tunnel and played in Game 7. He finished with just four points and three rebounds, but he played 27 minutes despite enduring a severe thigh injury four days prior. The Knicks went on to win fairly easily, establishing a 27-point lead at halftime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reed became the first player in NBA history to be named the Finals MVP, regular season MVP and All-Star game MVP in the same season. The NBA introduced the Finals MVP award in the 1969 NBA Finals.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the years following the 1973 title, the franchise was quiet — until the Knicks drafted Patrick Ewing No. 1 overall in the 1985 NBA Draft. New York went on to make 14 straight playoff appearances from 1988-2001.\n",
      "\n",
      "A majority of those appearances ended in the Eastern Conference semifinals, but the Ewing-led team reached the NBA Finals twice, in 1994 and 1999. Both times, however, the Knicks lost.\n",

The leaders hoped to dissuade Trump from making concessions to the Kremlin. The Washington Post has published several articles related to the meetings, including one about key moments from Trump and Zelensky's second White House meeting, and another on Europeans' reaction to Trump's promise of securing Ukraine.\n",

      "Summary: The US and NATO are developing a new mechanism for funding weapons transfers to Ukraine, where alliance members will purchase U.S.-supplied arms for Kyiv. This comes as President Trump has seemingly shifted his foreign policy in support of Kyiv, frustrated by Putin's objections to ending hostilities. The mechanism, spearheaded by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, aims to provide $10 billion in funding for Ukraine, with arms being delivered in tranches of about $500 million. Trump has demanded a peace deal by Aug. 8, threatening new tariffs on Russia and its economic partners if the Kremlin fails to halt its full-scale invasion.\n",

      "Summary: Donald Trump stated on August 11, 2025, that ending the war between Ukraine and Russia would require both countries to cede land. He planned to discuss a potential deal with Vladimir Putin, viewing the meeting as a \"feel-out meeting\" to gauge Putin's willingness to negotiate. Trump mentioned a possible three-way meeting with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He aimed for a speedy ceasefire, despite past resistance from both Russia and Ukraine to land swaps.\n",

      "Short answer: After the mid‑August 2025 Trump–Putin meeting in Alaska and Trump’s follow‑on talks with Ukraine’s President Zelensky in Washington, there is no ceasefire and heavy fighting continues. Trump is pushing for a direct Putin–Zelensky summit and a “permanent peace” without deploying U.S. ground troops, while hinting at possible U.S. air support as part of security guarantees. Kyiv publicly rejects territorial concessions. The EU is backing Ukraine’s territorial integrity, preparing a new (19th) Russia sanctions package, and tactically supporting Trump’s diplomacy to test the Kremlin’s intentions and justify tougher measures if Moscow stonewalls. European leaders welcome renewed U.S. engagement but remain wary of any deal that undercuts Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "What changed in August 2025\n",
      "- Trump–Putin (Alaska, Aug 15–16): No deal or ceasefire; Trump said “great progress,” but the Kremlin signaled talks need “gradual” preparation and played down an imminent summit. Putin told Trump he’s “open” to direct talks, but Moscow has not shifted on key demands. Fighting intensified around the talks (large Russian drone/missile barrages on Ukrainian energy targets). Sources: BBC, Aug 16–20; Al Jazeera, Aug 19–20.\n",
      "- Trump–Zelensky and European leaders (Washington, Aug 18–19): Trump proposed a direct Putin–Zelensky meeting and suggested moving straight to a permanent settlement rather than a prior ceasefire. He ruled out sending U.S. troops to Ukraine under any security guarantees but hinted the U.S. could provide support “by air.” Europeans pressed for a ceasefire first and for any agreement to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty. Sources: BBC, Aug 18–19; Al Jazeera, Aug 19–20; Washington Post, Aug 18–19.\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. stance now\n",
      "- Diplomacy: Pushing for a Putin–Zelensky summit; Trump says a ceasefire is not a prerequisite to talks and has floated controversial ideas like “land swaps,” which Kyiv rejects. Sources: BBC, Aug 18–19; U.S. News/Reuters, Aug 11.\n",
      "- Security guarantees: No U.S. ground troops; Trump has hinted at potential U.S. air support. Details remain vague. Sources: BBC live, Aug 19; Al Jazeera, Aug 20.\n",
      "- Aid mechanisms: U.S. and NATO exploring a new funding vehicle to keep weapons flowing to Ukraine via allied financing of U.S.-made arms, coordinated by NATO. Sources: Kyiv Independent (Reuters), Aug 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "EU stance now\n",
      "- Strategic posture: Publicly supportive of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and path to EU membership; opposes any settlement that changes borders by force. Sources: European Commission readout (von der Leyen–Zelensky), Aug 18.\n",
      "- Sanctions: Preparing a 19th package against Russia for early September and signaling openness to tougher measures, including pressure linked to Russia’s trade enablers. Sources: Politico Europe, Aug 17; EU statement, Aug 18; Politico Europe analysis, Aug 19.\n",
      "- On Trump’s initiative: Many EU leaders are skeptical Putin will compromise but back the talks anyway to “call Putin’s bluff,” positioning for tougher U.S.–EU sanctions if Moscow obstructs. Sources: Politico Europe, Aug 19; Washington Post, Aug 19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ukraine–Russia battlefield reality\n",
      "- No ceasefire. Russia launched one of its largest recent overnight attacks (270 drones and 10 missiles) amid the diplomatic push; Ukraine continues to insist on a ceasefire before substantive talks and rejects territorial concessions. Sources: Al Jazeera, Aug 19; BBC, Aug 17; Reuters via Yahoo, Aug 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to watch next\n",
      "- Whether a Putin–Zelensky meeting is actually scheduled and on what terms (ceasefire vs. talks under fire).\n",
      "- The shape of any U.S./NATO “security guarantees” that exclude ground troops but could include air defense and air support.\n",
      "- The EU’s September sanctions package and potential alignment with expanded U.S. measures if the Kremlin stalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources\n",
