      " New York City is beginning to feel like the center of the professional basketball world again. Months after the WNBA's Liberty won their first-ever title, the NBA's Knicks have snapped a decades-long Eastern Conference Finals drought to move within four wins of a Finals appearance and eight wins of a title. Fans in the Mecca of basketball have responded accordingly. Despite the drought, the Knicks are undeniably one of the most storied franchises in professional sports. With some of the greatest players in league history suiting up in orange and blue, New York has experienced some large-scale success, though it has been over 50 years since the franchise was the last one standing. 📲  Follow The Sporting News on WhatsApp With that in mind, The Sporting News revisits the Knicks' last NBA championship and the team's history in the NBA Finals. NBA PLAYOFFS HQ:   Live NBA scores  |  NBA playoff schedule  |  NBA playoff bracket When was the last time the Knicks won an NBA championship? The last time the Knicks won an NBA championship was in 1973. New York needed five games to defeat the Lakers on the game's biggest stage for the second time in four seasons. The 1973 Knicks team was a who's who of all-time greats, featuring five members of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team: Dave DeBusschere, Walt Frazier, Jerry Lucas, Earl Monroe, and Willis Reed. Reed was named Finals MVP with averages of 16.4 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists in the series, while Hall of Famer Bill Bradley led the team with 18.6 points per game in the series. In many ways, the 1972-73 Knicks felt like a team of destiny, surging their way through the playoffs with a 4-1 semifinals victory over the 52-win Baltimore Bullets (now Wizards) and a seven-game East Finals win over the 1-seed Celtics, who had won 68 games during the regular season. MORE:  Where Willis Reed's 1970 heroics rank among gutsiest performances in playoff history How many NBA championships have the Knicks won? The Knicks have won two championships in franchise history — both championship wins came in the 1970s. As one of the NBA's original franchises, the 1946-47 season was New York's first. After three consecutive Finals losses in the 1950s, the franchise finally got over the hump with a seven-game series win over the Lakers in the 1970 NBA Finals. Three years later, the Knicks' championship core remained largely intact when they needed just five games to defeat the Lakers in the 1973 Finals.

The Knicks' last NBA Finals appearance was in 1999 against the Spurs. San Antonio won the series, 4-1. New York has not been to the Finals since the turn of the century and, in addition to the Finals drought, had last appeared in the Eastern Conference Finals in 2000. The Knicks ended a 25-year conference finals drought with their run in 2025. Knicks NBA Finals history The Knicks have advanced to the NBA Finals eight times in franchise history, posting a 2-6 record in those series. New York's NBA Finals appearances are somewhat spread out, with three in the 1950s, three in the 1970s, and the remaining two in the 1990s. The franchise came painstakingly close to winning a title in 1994 but has not been able to hoist the trophy since 1973. Here is a breakdown of the Knicks' full NBA Finals history, which includes three Game 7 losses.

      "Text: The New York Knicks are one of the premier franchises in the history of the NBA, despite the fact that they have not had anywhere near the championship success as teams like the Boston Celtics or Los Angeles Lakers. The Knicks have not won an NBA championship since 1973. The 52 ensuing seasons since that title represent one of the longest droughts in the NBA, ranking behind the Sacramento Kings, Atlanta Hawks, Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Clippers. And it's probably felt just as long since their last trip to the NBA Finals. The last title for the orange and blue came in 1973. The Knicks joined the NBA in 1949. Led by Hall of Famers Dick McGuire and Harry Gallatin, they lost three straight NBA Finals from 1951 to 1953 losing to George Mikan's Minneapolis Lakers twice. In 1951 they lost to a Rochester Royals team that was led by Hall of Famers Arnie Risen and Bob Davies. The Royals also featured a point guard named Red Holzman. Holzman would eventually make the Hall of Fame himself after turning the Knicks into contenders in the late 1960s as their head coach. The Knicks won their first championship in the 1970 NBA Finals. After missing Game 6 of the series with an injury, Willis Reed helped will his team to a victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 7, hitting his first two shots of the game. Three years later the Knicks won again in a Finals rematch against the Lakers. Led by Holzman, Reed, Walt Frazier and future New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, the Knicks beat Jerry West and the Lakers in five games. The Knicks have not won a title since that era. The Knicks haven't been to the NBA Finals since 1999. They also haven't been to the conference finals since 2000 when they lost to the Indiana Pacers, Reggie Miller, Jalen Rose and head coach Larry Bird. Having not been to the conference finals in a quarter century, they own the longest drought in the NBA behind the Washington Wizards (46 years) and Charlotte Hornets, a franchise that has never been in 37 years. The Knicks' last NBA Finals appearance was in the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. The Knicks went 27–23 and finished one game ahead of the Charlotte Hornets for the No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference. That Knicks team was led by Latrell Sprewell, Allan Houston, Patrick Ewing and Larry Johnson. Ewing went down with an injury during the conference finals and the team advanced to the Finals for the first time since drafting him and the Ewing Theory was born. It's also worth mentioning that second-year guard Rick Brunson appeared in nine games during New York's last Finals run. His son, Jalen, was 2 years old at the time. The Knicks have played in eight NBA Finals, winning two. Those two titles tie New York with the Houston Rockets and Milwaukee Bucks for the ninth most all time.

      "Text: When did the New York Knicks last win the NBA Championship? The New York Knicks have not won the NBA Championship since 1973, when they were 4-1 series winners against the Los Angeles Lakers. They are into their first Eastern Conference final for 25 years after a 4-2 series win over defending champions the Boston Celtics. The Knicks wrapped up the series with one match to spare thanks to a 119-81 win at Madison Square Garden. The two-time champions will face the Indiana Pacers in the Conference finals, with the winner meeting either the Minnesota Timberwolves or Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals. OG Anunoby - one of two British players currently in the NBA - is among the Knicks' star players and started in all 86 of his appearances this season. Get in touch Is a 62-year wait coming to an end? While the Knicks are among the most recognised and popular NBA franchises, their quest for a third NBA finals title has lasted more than six decades. The Knicks have since featured in the 1994 and 1999 NBA finals, but were beaten by the Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs respectively. In four of the past five seasons, the Knicks have made the play-offs but lost in the Conference semi-finals. But in seven of the eight seasons between 2014-15 and 2021-22, they finished in the bottom five of the Eastern Conference. The Knicks' two NBA Finals wins were in 1970 and 1973. They also have four Conference and eight Division titles to their name. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, OG Anunoby of the New York Knicks is one of two British players in the NBA 'The Knicks' transformation is no accident' - analysis Sam Harris BBC Sport Journalist The New York Knicks' transformation into a legitimate Eastern Conference powerhouse is no accident - it's the product of astute front-office moves and a culture built on chemistry and grit. One of those big front-office moves came with the acquisition of Karl-Anthony Towns in late 2024. It was a trade that gave New York a true star in the frontcourt. Towns' inside-out scoring and rebounding dominance reshaped the Knicks' offense. But the most impactful upgrade might have been the addition of Mikal Bridges, who joined a familiar core of players forged from other Villanova college graduates Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart. That shared collegiate bond has produced a unique synergy that few teams can match. The result? A roster that defends as one, moves the ball instinctively, and embraces the moment. Leading it all is Jalen Brunson, whose rise from steady floor general to bona fide star has been nothing short of spectacular. Fresh from being named the NBA's Clutch Player of the Year, Brunson has delivered time and again in the postseason, nowhere more dramatically than in Game 4 against Boston, where his 39-point masterpiece powered a statement comeback win. He's the heartbeat of a Knicks team. Combined together it could be the case that after decades of searching, New York might finally have found the formula, not just for relevance, but for real contention.

      " 1970 NBA championship \n",
      " The Knicks went 60-22 during the 1969-70 regular season, which is still tied for their best regular season record in franchise history. They were led by Willis Reed, who was named the NBA MVP after averaging 21.7 points and 13.9 rebounds during the campaign. Walt Frazier also had an excellent campaign, averaging 20.9 points, 6.0 rebounds and 8.2 assists. That helped him finish fourth in MVP voting. Reed, Frazier and Dave DeBusschere were all named All-Stars. \n",
      " In the 1970 Eastern Division semifinals, the Knicks defeated the Baltimore Bullets in seven games. They then defeated the Bucks in the Eastern Division Finals in five games. The NBA Finals against the Lakers proved to be a back-and-forth battle in which neither team won consecutive games. In the end, the Knicks prevailed in seven games. Reed was named Finals MVP and averaged 23.7 points, 13.8 rebounds and 2.8 assists across 18 playoff games. Over 19 playoff games, Frazier averaged 16.0 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists. \n",

      " 1973 NBA championship \n",
      " The Knicks lost in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1971, then in the NBA Finals in 1972 to the Lakers. In the 1972-73 season, they went 57-25 with Frazier leading the way. He averaged 21.1 points, 7.3 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game. Reed appeared in 69 games but averaged just 11.0 points and 8.6 rebounds. What helped make up for Reed’s lack of scoring was that DeBusschere, Bill Bradley and Earl Monroe all averaged at least 15.5 points per game. \n",
      " The Knicks faced the Bullets again in the Eastern Conference semifinals, with the Knicks winning in five games. They then defeated the Celtics in seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals. The NBA Finals brought another matchup with the Lakers. After losing to the Lakers the season prior, the Knicks won in five games to bring home their second championship. Despite the series only lasting five games, four of the games were decided by five or fewer points. The Lakers won Game 1, but the Knicks then won four straight. \n",
      " Reed was named Finals MVP. After that, he played just 19 more regular season games in his career. Frazier was excellent in the playoffs, averaging 21.9 points, 7.3 rebounds and 6.2 assists over 17 games. It was also a great run for DeBusschere, who averaged 15.6 points, 10.5 rebounds and 3.4 assists over 17 games. \n",

The leaders hoped to dissuade Trump from making concessions to the Kremlin. The Washington Post has published several articles related to the meetings, including one about key moments from Trump and Zelensky's second White House meeting, and another on Europeans' reaction to Trump's promise of securing Ukraine.\n",

      "Summary: The US and NATO are developing a new mechanism for funding weapons transfers to Ukraine, where alliance members will purchase U.S.-supplied arms for Kyiv. This comes as President Trump has seemingly shifted his foreign policy in support of Kyiv, frustrated by Putin's objections to ending hostilities. The mechanism, spearheaded by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, aims to provide $10 billion in funding for Ukraine, with arms being delivered in tranches of about $500 million. Trump has demanded a peace deal by Aug. 8, threatening new tariffs on Russia and its economic partners if the Kremlin fails to halt its full-scale invasion.\n",

He planned to discuss a potential deal with Vladimir Putin, viewing the meeting as a \"feel-out meeting\" to gauge Putin's willingness to negotiate. Trump mentioned a possible three-way meeting with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

      "Short answer: After the mid‑August 2025 Trump–Putin meeting in Alaska and Trump’s follow‑on talks with Ukraine’s President Zelensky in Washington, there is no ceasefire and heavy fighting continues. Trump is pushing for a direct Putin–Zelensky summit and a “permanent peace” without deploying U.S. ground troops, while hinting at possible U.S. air support as part of security guarantees. Kyiv publicly rejects territorial concessions. The EU is backing Ukraine’s territorial integrity, preparing a new (19th) Russia sanctions package, and tactically supporting Trump’s diplomacy to test the Kremlin’s intentions and justify tougher measures if Moscow stonewalls. European leaders welcome renewed U.S. engagement but remain wary of any deal that undercuts Ukraine.\n",

      "What changed in August 2025\n",
      "- Trump–Putin (Alaska, Aug 15–16): No deal or ceasefire; Trump said “great progress,” but the Kremlin signaled talks need “gradual” preparation and played down an imminent summit. Putin told Trump he’s “open” to direct talks, but Moscow has not shifted on key demands. Fighting intensified around the talks (large Russian drone/missile barrages on Ukrainian energy targets). Sources: BBC, Aug 16–20; Al Jazeera, Aug 19–20.\n",
      "- Trump–Zelensky and European leaders (Washington, Aug 18–19): Trump proposed a direct Putin–Zelensky meeting and suggested moving straight to a permanent settlement rather than a prior ceasefire. He ruled out sending U.S. troops to Ukraine under any security guarantees but hinted the U.S. could provide support “by air.” Europeans pressed for a ceasefire first and for any agreement to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty. Sources: BBC, Aug 18–19; Al Jazeera, Aug 19–20; Washington Post, Aug 18–19.\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. stance now\n",
      "- Diplomacy: Pushing for a Putin–Zelensky summit; Trump says a ceasefire is not a prerequisite to talks and has floated controversial ideas like “land swaps,” which Kyiv rejects. Sources: BBC, Aug 18–19; U.S. News/Reuters, Aug 11.\n",
      "- Security guarantees: No U.S. ground troops; Trump has hinted at potential U.S. air support. Details remain vague. Sources: BBC live, Aug 19; Al Jazeera, Aug 20.\n",
      "- Aid mechanisms: U.S. and NATO exploring a new funding vehicle to keep weapons flowing to Ukraine via allied financing of U.S.-made arms, coordinated by NATO. Sources: Kyiv Independent (Reuters), Aug 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "EU stance now\n",
      "- Strategic posture: Publicly supportive of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and path to EU membership; opposes any settlement that changes borders by force. Sources: European Commission readout (von der Leyen–Zelensky), Aug 18.\n",
      "- Sanctions: Preparing a 19th package against Russia for early September and signaling openness to tougher measures, including pressure linked to Russia’s trade enablers. Sources: Politico Europe, Aug 17; EU statement, Aug 18; Politico Europe analysis, Aug 19.\n",
      "- On Trump’s initiative: Many EU leaders are skeptical Putin will compromise but back the talks anyway to “call Putin’s bluff,” positioning for tougher U.S.–EU sanctions if Moscow obstructs. Sources: Politico Europe, Aug 19; Washington Post, Aug 19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ukraine–Russia battlefield reality\n",
      "- No ceasefire. Russia launched one of its largest recent overnight attacks (270 drones and 10 missiles) amid the diplomatic push; Ukraine continues to insist on a ceasefire before substantive talks and rejects territorial concessions. Sources: Al Jazeera, Aug 19; BBC, Aug 17; Reuters via Yahoo, Aug 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to watch next\n",
      "- Whether a Putin–Zelensky meeting is actually scheduled and on what terms (ceasefire vs. talks under fire).\n",
      "- The shape of any U.S./NATO “security guarantees” that exclude ground troops but could include air defense and air support.\n",
      "- The EU’s September sanctions package and potential alignment with expanded U.S. measures if the Kremlin stalls.\n",
