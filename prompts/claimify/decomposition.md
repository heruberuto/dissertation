You are an assistant for a group of fact-checkers. You will be given a question, which was asked about a source text (it may be referred to by other names, 
e.g., a dataset). You will also be given an excerpt from a response to the question. If it contains "[...]", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. You will also be given a particular sentence from the response. The text before and after this sentence will be referred to as "the context".

Your task is to identify all specific and verifiable propositions in the sentence and ensure that each proposition is decontextualized. A proposition is "decontextualized" if (1) it is fully self-contained, meaning it can be understood in isolation (i.e., without the question, the context, and the other propositions), AND (2) its meaning in isolation matches its meaning when interpreted alongside the question, the context, and the other propositions. The propositions should also be the simplest possible discrete units of 
information.

Note the following rules:
- Here are some examples of sentences that do NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition:
    - By prioritizing ethical considerations, companies can ensure that their innovations are not only groundbreaking but also socially responsible
    - Technological progress should be inclusive
    - Leveraging advanced technologies is essential for maximizing productivity
    - Networking events can be crucial in shaping the paths of young entrepreneurs and providing them with valuable connections
    - AI could lead to advancements in healthcare
- Sometimes a specific and verifiable proposition is buried in a sentence that is mostly generic or unverifiable. For example, "John's notable research on neural networks demonstrates the power of innovation" contains the specific and verifiable proposition "John has research on neural networks". Another example is "TurboCorp exemplifies the positive effects that prioritizing ethical considerations over profit can have on innovation" where the specific and verifiable proposition is "TurboCorp prioritizes ethical considerations over profit".
- If the sentence indicates that a specific entity said or did something, it is critical that you retain this context when creating the propositions. For example, if the sentence is "John highlights the importance of transparent communication, such as in Project Alpha, which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year", the propositions would be ["John highlights the importance of transparent communication", "John highlights Project Alpha as an example of the importance of transparent communication", 
"Project Alpha aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year"]. The propositions "transparent communication is important" and "Project Alpha is an example of the importance of transparent communication" would be incorrect since they omit the context that these are things John highlights. However, the last part of the sentence, "which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year", is not likely a statement made by John, so it can be its own proposition. Note that if the sentence was something like "John's career underscores the importance of transparent communication", it's NOT about what John says or does but rather about how John's career can be interpreted, which is NOT a specific and verifiable proposition.
- If the context contains "[...]", we cannot see all preceding statements, so we do NOT know for sure whether the sentence is directly answering the question. It might be background information for some statements we can't see. Therefore, you should only assume the sentence is directly answering the question if this is strongly implied.
- Do NOT include any citations in the propositions.
- Do NOT use any external knowledge beyond what is stated in the question, context, and sentence.

Here are some correct examples that you must pay attention to:
1. Question = "Describe the history of TurboCorp", Context = "John Smith was an early employee who transitioned to management in 2010", Sentence = "At the time, John Smith, led the company's operations and finance teams"
    - MaxClarifiedSentence = In 2010, John Smith led TurboCorp's operations team and finance team.

First, print "Sentence:" followed by the sentence, Then print "Referential terms whose referents must be clarified (e.g., "other"):" followed by an overview of all terms in the sentence that explicitly or implicitly refer to other terms in the sentence, (e.g., "other" in "the Department of Education, the Department of Defense, and other agencies" refers to the Department of Education and the Department of Defense; "earlier" in "unlike the 2023 annual report, earlier reports" refers to the 2023 annual report) or None if there are no referential terms, Then print "MaxClarifiedSentence:" which articulates discrete units of information made by the sentence and clarifies referents, Then print "The range of the possible number of propositions (with some margin for variation) is:" followed by X-Y where X can be 0 or greater and X and Y must be different integers. Then print "Specific, Verifiable, and Decontextualized Propositions:" followed by a list of all propositions that are each specific, verifiable, and fully decontextualized. Use the format below:
[
"insert a specific, verifiable, and fully decontextualized proposition",
]
Next, it is EXTREMELY important that you consider that each fact-checker in the group will only have access to one of the propositions - they will not have access to the question, the context, and the other propositions. Print 
"Specific, Verifiable, and Decontextualized Propositions with Essential Context/Clarifications:" followed by a final list of instructions for the fact-checkers with **all essential clarifications and context** enclosed in square brackets: [...]. For example, the proposition "The local council expects its law to pass in January 2025" might become "The [Boston] local council expects its law 
[banning plastic bags] to pass in January 2025 - true or false?"; the proposition "Other agencies decreased their deficit" might become "Other agencies [besides the Department of Education and the Department of Defense] increased their deficit [relative to 2023] - true or false?"; the proposition 
"The CGP has called for the termination of hostilities" might become "The CGP 
[Committee for Global Peace] has called for the termination of hostilities [in the context of a discussion on the Middle East] - true or false?". Use the format below:
[
"<insert a specific, verifiable, and fully decontextualized proposition with as few or as many [...] as needed> - true or false?",
]
