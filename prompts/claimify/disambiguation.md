You are an assistant to a fact-checker. You will be given a question, which was asked about a source text (it may be referred to by other names, e.g., a disa
dataset). You will also be given an excerpt from a response to the question. If it contains "[...]", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. You will also be given a particular sentence from the response. The text before and after this sentence will be referred to as "the context". Your task is to "decontextualize" the sentence, which means:
1. determine whether it's possible to resolve partial names and undefined acronyms/abbreviations in the sentence using the question and the context; if it is possible, you will make the necessary changes to the sentence
2. determine whether the sentence in isolation contains linguistic ambiguity that has a clear resolution using the question and the context; if it does, you will make the necessary changes to the sentence

Note the following rules:
- "Linguistic ambiguity" refers to the presence of multiple possible meanings in a sentence. Vagueness and generality are NOT linguistic ambiguity. Linguistic ambiguity includes referential and structural ambiguity. Temporal ambiguity is a type of referential ambiguity.
- If it is unclear whether the sentence is directly answering the question, you should NOT count this as linguistic ambiguity. You should NOT add any information to the sentence that assumes a connection to the question.
- If a name is only partially given in the sentence, but the full name is provided in the question or the context, the DecontextualizedSentence must always use the full name. The same rule applies to definitions for acronyms and abbreviations. However, the lack of a full name or a definition for an acronym/abbreviation in the question and the context does NOT count as linguistic ambiguity; in this case, you will just leave the name, acronym, or abbreviation as is.
- Do NOT include any citations in the DecontextualizedSentence.
- Do NOT use any external knowledge beyond what is stated in the question, context, and sentence.

Here are some correct examples that you should pay attention to:
1. Question = "Describe the history of TurboCorp", Context = "John Smith was an early employee who transitioned to management in 2010", Sentence = "At the time, he led the company's operations and finance teams."
    - For referential ambiguity, "At the time", "he", and "the company's" are unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: "At the time" corresponds to 2010, "he" refers to John Smith, and "the company's" refers to TurboCorp.
    - DecontextualizedSentence: In 2010, John Smith led TurboCorp's operations and finance teams.
2. Question = "Who are notable executive figures?", Context = "[...]**Jane Doe**", Sentence = "These notes indicate that her leadership at TurboCorp and MiniMax is accelerating progress in renewable energy and sustainable 
agriculture."
    - For referential ambiguity, "these notes" and "her" are unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of "these notes", since there is no indication in the question or context. However, they would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation of "her": Jane Doe.
    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) Jane's leadership is accelerating progress in renewable energy and sustainable agriculture at both TurboCorp and MiniMax, (2) Jane's leadership is accelerating progress in renewable energy at TurboCorp and in sustainable agriculture at MiniMax. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of this ambiguity.
    - DecontextualizedSentence: Cannot be decontextualized
3. Question = "Who founded MiniMax?", Context = "None", Sentence = "Executives like John Smith were involved in the early days of MiniMax."
    - For referential ambiguity, "like John Smith" is unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: John Smith is an example of an executive who was involved in the early days of MiniMax.
    - Note that "Involved in" and "the early days" are vague, but they are NOT linguistic ambiguity.
    - DecontextualizedSentence: John Smith is an example of an executive who was involved in the early days of MiniMax.
4. Question = "What advice is given to young entrepreneurs?", Context = 
"# Ethical Considerations", Sentence = "Sustainable manufacturing, as emphasized by John Smith and Jane Doe, is critical for customer buy-in and long-term success."
    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) John Smith and Jane Doe emphasized that sustainable manufacturing is critical for customer buy-in and long-term success, (2) John Smith and Jane Doe emphasized sustainable manufacturing while the claim that sustainable manufacturing is critical for customer buy-in and long-term success is attributable to the writer, not to John Smith and Jane Doe. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of this ambiguity.
    - DecontextualizedSentence: Cannot be decontextualized
5. Question = "What are common strategies for building successful teams?", Context = "One of the most common strategies is creating a diverse team.", Sentence = "Last winter, John Smith highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations, which can drive advancements by integrating diverse perspectives from fields such as artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and statistical machine learning."
    - For referential ambiguity, "Last winter" is unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of this ambiguity, since there is no indication of the time period in the question or context.
    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) John Smith highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations and that they can drive advancements by integrating diverse perspectives from some example fields, (2) John Smith only highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations while the claim that they can drive advancements by integrating diverse perspectives from some example fields is attributable to the writer, not to John Smith. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of this ambiguity.
    - DecontextualizedSentence: Cannot be decontextualized
6. Question = "What opinions are provided on disruptive technologies?", Context = "[...]However, there is a divergence in how to weigh short-term benefits against long-term risks.", Sentence = "These differences are illustrated by the discussion on healthcare: some stress AI's benefits, while others highlight its risks, such as privacy and data security."
    - For referential ambiguity, "These differences" is unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: the differences are with respect to how to weigh short-term benefits against long-term risks.
    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) privacy and data security are examples of risks, (2) privacy and data security are examples of both benefits and risks. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: privacy and data security are examples of risks.
    - Note that "Some" and "others" are vague, but they are not linguistic ambiguity.
    - DecontextualizedSentence: The differences in how to weigh short-term benefits against long-term risks are illustrated by the discussion on healthcare. Some experts stress AI's benefits with respect to healthcare. Other experts highlight AI's risks with respect to healthcare, such as privacy and data security.

First, print "Incomplete Names, Acronyms, Abbreviations:" followed by your step-by-step reasoning for determining whether the Sentence contains any partial names and undefined acronyms/abbreviations. If the full names and definitions are provided in the question or context, the Sentence will be updated accordingly; otherwise, they will be left as is and they will NOT count as linguistic ambiguity. Next, print "Linguistic Ambiguity in '<insert the 
sentence>':" followed by your step-by-step reasoning for checking (1) referential and (2) structural ambiguity (and note that 1. referential ambiguity is NOT equivalent to vague or general language and it includes temporal ambiguity, and 2. structural reasoning must follow "The sentence could be interpreted as: <insert one or multiple interpretations>"), then considering whether a group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus or fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of the linguistic ambiguity. If they would likely fail to reach consensus, print
"DecontextualizedSentence: Cannot be decontextualized"; otherwise, first print
"Changes Needed to Decontextualize the Sentence:" followed by a list of all changes needed to ensure the Sentence is fully decontextualized (e.g., replace 
"executives like John Smith" with "John Smith is an example of an executive who") and includes all full names and definitions for acronyms/abbreviations (only if they were provided in the question and the context), then print 
"DecontextualizedSentence:" followed by the final sentence (or collection of sentences) that implements all changes.
